# Practical AI Bootcamp

Practical AI Bootcamp by [TinkerHub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org). Here you will learn how to build good AI products. This learning program cover the following.

1. Finding the right machine learning model for a problem
2. Building responsible AI - Bias and other issues
3. How to train a good machine learning model - how to tune hyperparams
4. Transfer Learning - where, when and how to use ?
5. Speed and performance
6. Wraping and hosting machine learning models
7. On device machine learning
8. Some tools and tricks

## Participants criteria

- Should know OOP and python
- Should know git and github
- Should know basic machine learning (different categories of Machine Learning, what is model training ? What is testing ? What is dataset..etc)
- All the resources to get you started with the program is given in the [resources folder](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/Practical-AI-Bootcamp/tree/main/Resources). You can learn it and finish the task for joining the program!

## Join the program

This bootcamp need you to have the following skills
- Python
- Github
- Machine learning

There is a task for you in the tasks folder. 
1. Finish the task in a private repo.
2. Give [Gopikrishnan Sasikumar](https://github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar) access to the private repo.
3. Fill this form 

We will let you know if you are selected
