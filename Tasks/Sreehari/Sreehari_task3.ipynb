      "b'Plow in a day (for mules the ox surpass'\n",

      "b\"But when within spear's cast, or less they came,\"\n",

      "b'Around Cebriones stood many a spear,'\n",

      "b'Then came a Dardan Chief, who from behind'\n",

      "b'Our friends by Priameian Hector slain,'\n",
      "b'Now strew the field mangled, for him hath Jove'\n",

      "b'And persevering with the host of Troy.'\n",
      "b'So saying, the sons of Nestor, glorious Chief,'\n",
      "b\"He chose, with Meges Phyleus' noble son,\"\n",
      "b'Thoas, Meriones, and Melanippus'\n",
      "b'And Lycomedes. These, together, sought'\n",
      "b'The tent of Agamemnon, King of men.'\n",
      "b\"They ask'd, and they received. Soon they produced\"\n",
      "b'The seven promised tripods from the tent,'\n",

      "b\"Seven lovely captives skill'd alike in arts\"\n",

      "b'King Agamemnon, and Talthybius'\n",
      "b'The herald, clear in utterance as a God,'\n",
      "b'Beside him stood, holding the victim boar.'\n",

      "b\"To Jove he pray'd, while, all around, the Greeks\"\n",
      "b\"Sat listening silent to the Sovereign's voice.\"\n",
      "b\"He look'd to the wide heaven, and thus he pray'd.\"\n",
      "b'First, Jove be witness! of all Powers above'\n",
      "b'Best and supreme; Earth next, and next the Sun!'\n",
      "b'And last, who under Earth the guilt avenge'\n",
      "b'Of oaths sworn falsely, let the Furies hear!'\n",
      "b'For no respect of amorous desire'\n",
      "b'Or other purpose, have I laid mine hand'\n",
      "b'On fair Bris\\xc3\\xabis, but within my tent'\n",
      "b\"Untouch'd, immaculate she hath remain'd.\"\n",

      "b'And, whirling him around, Talthybius, next,'\n",
      "b\"Cast him into the ocean, fishes' food.\"\n",
      "b\"Then, in the centre of Achaia's sons\"\n",
      "b'Uprose Achilles, and thus spake again.'\n",
      "b'Jove! Father! dire calamities, effects'\n",
      "b'Of thy appointment, fall on human-kind.'\n",
      "b'Never had Agamemnon in my breast'\n",
      "b'Such anger kindled, never had he seized,'\n",
      "b'Blinded by wrath, and torn my prize away,'\n",
      "b'But that the slaughter of our numerous friends'\n",
      "b'Which thence ensued, thou hadst, thyself, ordained.'\n",
      "b'Now go, ye Grecians, eat, and then to battle.'\n",
      "b'So saying, Achilles suddenly dissolved'\n",
      "b'The hasty council, and all flew dispersed'\n",
      "b'To their own ships. Then took the Myrmidons'\n",
      "b'Those splendid gifts which in the tent they lodged'\n",
      "b'Of swift Achilles, and the damsels led'\n",
      "b'Each to a seat, while others of his train'\n",

      "b'I left thee living, and now, generous Chief!'\n",
      "b'Restored to it again, here find thee dead.'\n",
      "b'How rapid in succession are my woes!'\n",
      "b'I saw, myself, the valiant prince to whom'\n",
      "b\"My parents had betroth'd me, slain before\"\n",
      "b'Our city walls; and my three brothers, sons'\n",

      "b'Then, shouting terrible, and clothed with might,'\n",
      "b'Achilles sprang to battle. First, he slew'\n",

      "b'Him to Otrynteus, city-waster Chief,'\n",
      "b'A Naiad under snowy Tmolus bore'\n",
      "b'In fruitful Hyda. Right into his front'\n",

      "b'The terrible in arms, who born beside'\n",
      "b'The broad Gyg\\xc3\\xa6an lake, where Hyllus flows'\n",

      "b\"Demoleon next, Antenor's son, a brave\"\n",
      "b'Defender of the walls of Troy, he slew.'\n",
      "b'Into his temples through his brazen casque'\n",
      "b'He thrust the Pelian ash, nor could the brass'\n",
      "b'Such force resist, but the huge weapon drove'\n",
      "b\"The shatter'd bone into his inmost brain,\"\n",
      "b\"And his fierce onset at a stroke repress'd.\"\n",
      "b'Hippodamas his weapon next received'\n",
      "b'Within his spine, while with a leap he left'\n",

      "b'Then, spear in hand, against the godlike son'\n",

      "b'Not yet his father had to him indulged'\n",
      "b\"A warrior's place, for that of all his sons\"\n",
      "b\"He was the youngest-born, his hoary sire's\"\n",
      "b\"Chief darling, and in speed surpass'd them all.\"\n",
      "b'Then also, in the vanity of youth,'\n",
      "b'For show of nimbleness, he started oft'\n",

      "b'Him gliding swiftly by, swifter than he'\n",
      "b\"Achilles with a javelin reach'd; he struck\"\n",
      "b'His belt behind him, where the golden clasps'\n",
      "b'Met, and the double hauberk interposed.'\n",
      "b'The point transpierced his bowels, and sprang through'\n",

      "b'Inclined, and with his bowels in his hands,'\n",
      "b'Sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure'\n",
      "b'No longer to remain aloof; flame-like'\n",
      "b'He burst abroad, and shaking his sharp spear,'\n",
      "b'Advanced to meet Achilles, whose approach'\n",

      "b'And thus, exulting, to himself he said.'\n",
      "b'Ah! he approaches, who hath stung my soul'\n",
      "b'Deepest, the slayer of whom most I loved!'\n",
      "b'Behold, we meet! Caution is at an end,'\n",
      "b'And timid skulking in the walks of war.'\n",
      "b'He ceased, and with a brow knit into frowns,'\n",

      "b'That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades.'\n",
      "b\"Whom answer'd warlike Hector, nought appall'd.\"\n",
      "b'Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,'\n",

      "b'By me, is at the pleasure of the Gods,'\n",
      "b'For I wield also not a pointless beam.'\n",

      "b'Which Pallas, breathing softly, wafted back'\n",
      "b\"From the renown'd Achilles, and it fell\"\n",

      "b\"And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim'd.\"\n",
      "b'Dog! thou art safe, and hast escaped again;'\n",
      "b'But narrowly, and by the aid once more'\n",

      "b\"And Pallas thus in accents wing'd exclaim'd.\"\n",
      "b'I would that all who on the part of Troy'\n",

      "b\"They fill'd and shut it fast, nor dared to wait\"\n",
      "b'Each other in the field, or to inquire'\n",

      "b'But if thou pity him, and deem it good,'\n",

      "b'Apart from all the people each put on'\n",

      "b'Of Ajax, bade them, ceasing, share the prize.'\n",

      "b\"Sent smartly forth, but vow'd not to the King\"\n",
      "b'A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock.'\n",
      "b'He therefore (for Apollo greater praise'\n",

      "b'Of noble Hector, for so long I mean'\n",
      "b'Myself to rest, and keep the host at home?'\n",
      "b'Then thus the ancient King godlike replied.'\n",

      "b'First Paris threw his weighty spear, and struck'\n",
      "b\"Fair in the midst Atrides' buckler round,\"\n",
      "b'But broke not through; upon the stubborn targe'\n",
      "b\"Was bent the lance's point; then thus to Jove,\"\n",
      "b\"His weapon hurling, Menelaus pray'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Great King, on him who wrought me causeless wrong,'\n",
      "b'On Paris, grant that retribution due'\n",
      "b'My arm may bring; that men in days to come'\n",
      "b'May fear their host to injure, and repay'\n",
      "b'With treach\\'rous wile his hospitable cares.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and poising, hurl'd his weighty spear:\"\n",
      "b'Full in the midst it struck the buckler round;'\n",
      "b\"Right through the buckler pass'd the sturdy spear,\"\n",
      "b'And through the gorgeous breastplate, and within'\n",
      "b'Cut through the linen vest; but Paris, back'\n",
      "b\"Inclining, stoop'd, and shunn'd the doom of death.\"\n",
      "b'Atrides then his silver-studded sword'\n",
      "b'Rearing on high, a mighty blow let fall'\n",
      "b\"On Paris' helm; but shiv'ring in his hand\"\n",
      "b'In countless fragments new the faithless blade.'\n",
      "b\"Then thus to Jove, with eyes uplift to Heav'n,\"\n",
      "b'Atrides made his moan: \"O Father Jove!'\n",
      "b'Of all the Gods, the most unfriendly thou!'\n",
      "b\"On Paris' head I hop'd for all his crimes\"\n",

      "b\"And endless fame acquir'd; but Venus, child\"\n",
      "b\"Of Jove, her fav'rite's peril quickly saw.\"\n",
      "b\"And broke the throttling strap of tough bull's hide.\"\n",
      "b'In the broad hand the empty helm remained.'\n",

      "b\"The well-greav'd Greeks, his eager comrades seiz'd;\"\n",
      "b\"While he, infuriate, rush'd with murd'rous aim\"\n",

      "b\"(As Gods can only) from the field convey'd,\"\n",
      "b'Wrapt in a misty cloud; and on a couch,'\n",
      "b'Sweet perfumes breathing, gently laid him down;'\n",

      "b\"Circled with Trojan dames, on Ilium's tow'r:\"\n",
      "b'Her by her airy robe the Goddess held,'\n",
      "b'And in the likeness of an aged dame'\n",
      "b'Who oft for her, in Sparta when she dwelt,'\n",
      "b\"Many a fair fleece had wrought, and lov'd her well,\"\n",
      "b'Address\\'d her thus: \"Come, Helen, to thy house;'\n",

      "b\"In costly garb, with manly beauty grac'd:\"\n",

      "b\"He late had come, but for the dance prepar'd,\"\n",
      "b'Or resting from the dance\\'s pleasing toil.\"'\n",
      "b\"She said, and Helen's spirit within her mov'd;\"\n",
      "b\"And when she saw the Goddess' beauteous neck,\"\n",
      "b'Her lovely bosom, and her glowing eyes,'\n",
      "b\"She gaz'd in wonder, and address'd her thus:\"\n",
      "b'\"Oh why, great Goddess, make me thus thy sport?'\n",
      "b\"Seek'st thou to bear me far away from hence\"\n",
      "b'To some fair Phrygian or Maeonian town,'\n",
      "b\"If there some mortal have thy favour gain'd?\"\n",

      "b'That I, his bane, should to his home return;'\n",
      "b'Here art thou found, to weave again thy wiles!'\n",
      "b'Go then thyself! thy godship abdicate!'\n",
      "b'Renounce Olympus! lavish here on him'\n",
      "b'Thy pity and thy care! he may perchance'\n",

      "b'My soul with endless sorrow is possess\\'d.\"'\n",
      "b\"To whom in anger heav'nly Venus spoke:\"\n",

      "b'Desert thee quite, and as I heretofore'\n",
      "b\"Have lov'd, so make thee object of my hate;\"\n",
      "b\"And kindle, 'twixt the Trojans and the Greeks,\"\n",
      "b'Such bitter feuds, as both shall wreak on thee.\"'\n",
      "b'She said; and trembled Helen, child of Jove;'\n",
      "b'She rose in silence; in a snow-white veil'\n",
      "b\"All glitt'ring, shrouded; by the Goddess led\"\n",
      "b\"She pass'd, unnotic'd by the Trojan dames.\"\n",

      "b\"The leech shall tend thy wound, and spread it o'er\"\n",
      "b'With healing ointments to assuage the pain.\"'\n",

      "b\"But when the wound appear'd in sight, where struck\"\n",

      "b\"The stinging arrow struck; right through it pass'd,\"\n",
      "b\"And held its way, that blood the breastplate stain'd.\"\n",
      "b\"Then shouted loud Lycaon's noble son:\"\n",
      "b'\"Arouse ye, valiant Trojans, ye who goad'\n",
      "b'Your flying steeds; the bravest of the Greeks'\n",
      "b'Is wounded, nor, I deem, can long withstand'\n",
      "b\"My weapon, if indeed from Lycia's shore\"\n",
      "b'By Phoebus\\' counsel sent I join\\'d the war.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus he, vain-glorious; but not so was quell'd\"\n",
      "b'The godlike chief; back he withdrew, and stood'\n",
      "b'Beside his car, and thus to Sthenelus,'\n",
      "b\"The son of Capaneus, his speech address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Up, gentle son of Capaneus, descend'\n",
      "b'From off the car, and from my shoulder draw'\n",
      "b'This stinging arrow forth.\" He said, and down'\n",
      "b\"Leap'd from the chariot Sthenelus, and stood\"\n",
      "b'Beside him; and as forth he drew the shaft,'\n",
      "b\"Gush'd out the blood, and dyed the twisted mail.\"\n",
      "b\"Then thus the valiant son of Tydeus pray'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Hear me, thou child of aegis-bearing Jove,'\n",
      "b\"Unconquer'd! if amid the deadly fight\"\n",
      "b\"Thy friendly aid my father e'er sustain'd,\"\n",
      "b'Let me in turn thy favour find; and grant'\n",
      "b'Within my reach and compass of my spear'\n",
      "b'That man may find himself, who unawares'\n",
      "b'Hath wounded me, and vainly boasting deems'\n",
      "b'I shall not long behold the light of day.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus pray'd the chief, and Pallas heard his pray'r;\"\n",
      "b'To all his limbs, to feet and hands alike,'\n",
      "b'She gave fresh vigour; and with winged words,'\n",
      "b\"Beside him as she stood, address'd him thus:\"\n",
      "b'\"Go fearless onward, Diomed, to meet'\n",
      "b'The Trojan hosts; for I within thy breast'\n",
      "b\"Thy father's dauntless courage have infus'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Such as of old in Tydeus' bosom dwelt,\"\n",
      "b'Bold horseman, buckler-clad; and from thine eyes'\n",
      "b\"The film that dimm'd them I have purg'd away,\"\n",
      "b\"That thou mayst well 'twixt Gods and men discern.\"\n",
      "b'If then some God make trial of thy force,'\n",
      "b\"With other of th' Immortals fight thou not;\"\n",
      "b\"But should Jove's daughter Venus dare the fray\"\n",
      "b'Thou needst not shun at her to cast thy spear.\"'\n",
      "b\"This said, the blue-ey'd Goddess disappear'd.\"\n",
      "b'Forthwith again amid the foremost ranks'\n",
      "b'Tydides mingled; keenly as before'\n",
      "b\"His spirit against the Trojans burn'd to fight,\"\n",
      "b'With threefold fury now he sought the fray.'\n",
      "b\"As when a hungry lion has o'erleap'd\"\n",
      "b'The sheepfold; him the guardian of the flock'\n",
      "b'Has wounded, not disabled; by his wound'\n",
      "b\"To rage excited, but not forc'd to fly,\"\n",
      "b'The fold he enters, scares the trembling sheep,'\n",
      "b'That, closely huddled, each on other press,'\n",
      "b'Then pounces on his prey, and leaps the fence:'\n",

      "b'Astynous and Hypeiron then he slew,'\n",
      "b\"His people's guardian; through the breast of one\"\n",
      "b'He drove his spear, and with his mighty sword'\n",
      "b'He smote the other on the collar-bone,'\n",
      "b\"The shoulder sev'ring from the neck and back.\"\n",
      "b'Them left he there to lie; of Abas then'\n",

      "b'And to their father left a load of grief,'\n",
      "b\"That from the battle they return'd not home,\"\n",

      "b\"The godlike Pandarus; Lycaon's son\"\n",
      "b'He found, of noble birth and stalwart form,'\n",
      "b\"And stood before him, and address'd him thus:\"\n",

      "b'Thy bow, and well-known skill, wherein with thee'\n",
      "b'Can no man here contend? nor Lycia boasts,'\n",

      "b'Then raise to Jove thy hands, and with thy shaft'\n",
      "b\"Strike down this chief, whoe'er he be, that thus\"\n",
      "b'Is making fearful havoc in our host,'\n",
      "b\"Relaxing many a warrior's limbs in death:\"\n",
      "b\"If he be not indeed a God, incens'd\"\n",
      "b'Against the Trojans for neglected rites;'\n",
      "b'For fearful is the vengeance of a God.\"'\n",
      "b\"Whom answer'd thus Lycaon's noble son:\"\n",
      "b'\"AEneas, chief and councillor of Troy,'\n",
      "b\"Most like in all respects to Tydeus' son\"\n",
      "b\"He seems; his shield I know, and visor'd helm,\"\n",
      "b'And horses; whether he himself be God,'\n",
      "b'I cannot tell; but if he be indeed'\n",
      "b\"The man I think him, Tydeus' valiant son,\"\n",
      "b\"He fights not thus without the aid of Heav'n;\"\n",
      "b'But by his side, his shoulders veiled in cloud,'\n",
      "b'Some God attends his steps, and turns away'\n",
      "b\"The shaft that just hath reach'd him; for ev'n now\"\n",
      "b\"A shaft I shot, which by the breastplate's joint\"\n",
      "b\"Pierc'd his right shoulder through: full sure I deem'd\"\n",
      "b'That shaft had sent him to the shades, and yet'\n",
      "b\"It slew him not; 'tis sure some angry God.\"\n",
      "b'Nor horse have I, nor car on which to mount;'\n",
      "b\"But in my sire Lycaon's wealthy house\"\n",
      "b\"Elev'n fair chariots stand, all newly built,\"\n",
      "b'Each with its cover; by the side of each'\n",
      "b'Two steeds on rye and barley white are fed;'\n",
      "b'And in his well-built house, when here I came,'\n",
      "b\"Lycaon, aged warrior, urg'd me oft\"\n",
      "b'With horses and with chariots high upborne,'\n",
      "b'To lead the Trojans in the stubborn fight;'\n",
      "b\"I hearken'd not--'twere better if I had--\"\n",
      "b\"Yet fear'd I lest my horses, wont to feed\"\n",
      "b\"In plenty unstinted, by the soldiers' wants\"\n",
      "b\"Might of their custom'd forage be depriv'd;\"\n",
      "b'I left them there, and hither came on foot,'\n",
      "b'And trusting to my bow: vain trust, it seems;'\n",
      "b'Two chiefs already have I struck, the sons'\n",
      "b'Of Tydeus and of Atreus; with true aim'\n",
      "b\"Drawn blood from both, yet but increas'd their rage.\"\n",
      "b'Sad was the hour when down from where it hung'\n",
      "b'I took my bow, and hasting to the aid'\n",
      "b'Of godlike Hector, hither led my troops;'\n",
      "b\"But should I e'er return, and see again\"\n",
      "b'My native land, my wife, my lofty hall,'\n",
      "b\"Then may a stranger's sword cut off my head,\"\n",

      "b\"Him answer'd thus AEneas, chief of Troy:\"\n",
      "b'\"Speak thou not thus; our fortunes shall not change'\n",
      "b'Till thou and I, with chariot and with horse,'\n",
      "b'This chief encounter, and his prowess prove;'\n",

      "b'Hither and thither, in pursuit or flight,'\n",
      "b'From those of Tros descended, scour the plain.'\n",
      "b'So if the victory to Diomed,'\n",

      "b'We yet may safely reach the walls of Troy.'\n",
      "b'Take thou the whip and reins, while I descend'\n",
      "b'To fight on foot; or thou the chief engage,'\n",
      "b'And leave to me the conduct of the car.\"'\n",
      "b\"Whom answer'd thus Lycaon's noble son:\"\n",
      "b'\"AEneas, of thy horses and thy car'\n",
      "b\"Take thou the charge; beneath th' accustomed hand,\"\n",
      "b'With more assurance would they draw the car,'\n",
      "b\"If we from Tydeus' son be forced to fly;\"\n",
      "b'Nor, struck with panic, and thy voice unheard,'\n",
      "b'Refuse to bear us from the battle-field;'\n",

      "b'While I his onset with my lance receive.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus saying, on the car they mounted both,'\n",
      "b\"And tow'rd Tydides urg'd their eager steeds.\"\n",
      "b'Them Sthenelus beheld, the noble son'\n",
      "b'Of Capaneus, and to Tydides cried:'\n",
      "b'\"Oh son of Tydeus, dearest to my soul,'\n",
      "b'Two men I see, of might invincible,'\n",
      "b'Impatient to engage thee; Pandarus,'\n",

      "b\"With him. AEneas, great Anchises' son,\"\n",
      "b'Who from immortal Venus boasts his birth.'\n",

      "b'It is not in my nature so to fight'\n",
      "b'With skulking artifice and faint retreat;'\n",
      "b'My strength is yet unbroken; I should shame'\n",

      "b\"To meet these chiefs' encounter; for my soul\"\n",

      "b\"Nor shall their horses' speed procure for both\"\n",
      "b'A safe return, though one escape my arm.'\n",
      "b'This too I say, and bear my words in mind;'\n",
      "b\"By Pallas' counsel if my hap should be\"\n",
      "b'To slay them both, leave thou my horses here,'\n",
      "b'The reins attaching to the chariot-rail,'\n",
      "b'And seize, and from the Trojans to the ships'\n",
      "b\"Drive off the horses in AEneas' car;\"\n",
      "b'From those descended, which all-seeing Jove'\n",

      "b'With these may none beneath the sun compare.'\n",
      "b\"Anchises, King of men, the breed obtain'd\"\n",

      "b'Without the knowledge of Laomedon.'\n",
      "b\"Six colts were thus engender'd: four of these\"\n",
      "b\"In his own stalls he rear'd; the other two\"\n",
      "b'Gave to AEneas, fear-inspiring chief:'\n",
      "b'These could we win, our praise were great indeed.\"'\n",
      "b\"Such converse while they held, the twain approach'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Their horses urg'd to speed; then thus began,\"\n",

      "b'\"Great son of Tydeus, warrior brave and skill\\'d,'\n",
      "b\"My shaft, it seems, has fail'd to reach thy life;\"\n",
      "b'Try we then now what hap attends my spear.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and, poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear,\"\n",
      "b\"And struck Tydides' shield; right through the shield\"\n",
      "b\"Drove the keen weapon, and the breastplate reach'd.\"\n",
      "b\"Then shouted loud Lycaon's noble son:\"\n",
      "b'\"Thou hast it through the flank, nor canst thou long'\n",

      "b\"Crash'd thro' the teeth, and cutting thro' the tongue\"\n",
      "b'Beneath the angle of the jaw came forth:'\n",
      "b'Down from the car he fell; and loudly rang'\n",
      "b\"His glitt'ring arms: aside the startled steeds\"\n",
      "b'Sprang devious: from his limbs the spirit fled.'\n",
      "b\"Down leap'd AEneas, spear and shield in hand,\"\n",
      "b'Against the Greeks to guard the valiant dead;'\n",
      "b'And like a lion, fearless in his strength,'\n",

      "b'His spear and buckler round before him held,'\n",
      "b\"To all who dar'd approach him threat'ning death,\"\n",
      "b'With fearful shouts; a rocky fragment then'\n",
      "b'Tydides lifted up, a mighty mass,'\n",
      "b'Which scarce two men could raise, as men are now:'\n",
      "b'But he, unaided, lifted it with ease.'\n",
      "b'With this he smote AEneas near the groin,'\n",
      "b'Where the thigh-bone, inserted in the hip,'\n",
      "b'Turns in the socket-joint; the rugged mass'\n",
      "b\"The socket crush'd, and both the tendons broke,\"\n",
      "b'And tore away the flesh: down on his knees,'\n",
      "b'Yet resting on his hand, the hero fell;'\n",

      "b'His reins attaching to the chariot-rail,'\n",
      "b\"Far from the battle-din he check'd, and left,\"\n",
      "b\"His own fleet steeds; then rushing forward, seiz'd,\"\n",

      "b\"The bravest of th' AEtolians, Periphas,\"\n",

      "b'Guided by Pallas, with successful aim,'\n",
      "b'Just where the belt was girt, the weapon struck:'\n",
      "b\"It pierc'd the flesh, and straight was back withdrawn:\"\n",
      "b'Then Mars cried out aloud, with such a shout'\n",

      "b\"Though vex'd; nor think with Hector to contend,\"\n",
      "b'Thy better far, inspiring dread in all.'\n",
      "b'From his encounter in the glorious fight,'\n",
      "b'Superior far to thee, Achilles shrinks;'\n",
      "b\"But thou amid thy comrades' ranks retire;\"\n",
      "b'Some other champion will the Greeks provide;'\n",
      "b'And, fearless as he is, and of the fight'\n",
      "b\"Insatiate, yet will Hector, should he 'scape\"\n",
      "b'Unwounded from the deadly battle-strife,'\n",
      "b'Be fain, methinks, to rest his weary limbs.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and with judicious counsel sway'd\"\n",
      "b\"His brother's mind; he yielded to his words,\"\n",
      "b\"And gladly his attendants doff'd his arms.\"\n",
      "b\"Then Nestor rose, and thus address'd the Greeks:\"\n",
      "b'\"Alas, alas! what shame is this for Greece!'\n",
      "b\"What grief would fill the aged Peleus' soul,\"\n",
      "b'Sage chief in council, of the Myrmidons'\n",
      "b\"Leader approv'd, who often in his house\"\n",
      "b\"Would question me, and lov'd from me to hear\"\n",
      "b'Of all the Greeks the race and pedigree,'\n",
      "b\"Could he but learn how Hector cow'd them all!\"\n",
      "b\"He to the Gods with hands uprais'd would pray\"\n",
      "b\"His soul might from his body be divorc'd,\"\n",
      "b'And sink beneath the earth! Oh would to Jove,'\n",
      "b'To Pallas and Apollo, such were now'\n",
      "b\"My vig'rous youth, as when beside the banks\"\n",
      "b'Of swiftly-flowing Celadon, the men'\n",
      "b\"Of Pylos with th' Arcadian spearmen fought,\"\n",
      "b\"By Pheia's walls, around Iardan's streams.\"\n",
      "b'Then from the ranks, in likeness as a God,'\n",
      "b\"Advanc'd their champion, Ereuthalion bold.\"\n",
      "b'The arms of Areithous he wore:'\n",
      "b'Of godlike Areithous, whom men'\n",
      "b\"And richly-girdled women had surnam'd\"\n",
      "b'The Macebearer; for not with sword or bow'\n",
      "b'He went to fight, but with an iron mace'\n",
      "b'Broke through the squadrons: him Lycurgus slew,'\n",
      "b\"By stealth, not brav'ry, in a narrow way,\"\n",
      "b\"Where nought avail'd his iron mace from death\"\n",
      "b'To save him; for Lycurgus, with his spear,'\n",
      "b'Preventing, thrust him through the midst; he fell'\n",
      "b\"Prostrate; and from his breast the victor stripp'd\"\n",
      "b'His armour off, the gift of brass-clad Mars;'\n",
      "b'And in the tug of war he wore it oft;'\n",
      "b\"But when Lycurgus felt th' approach of age,\"\n",
      "b'He to his faithful follower and friend,'\n",
      "b\"To Ereuthalion gave it; therewith, arm'd,\"\n",
      "b\"He now to combat challeng'd all the chiefs.\"\n",
      "b\"None dar'd accept, for fear had fallen on all;\"\n",
      "b\"Then I with dauntless spirit his might oppos'd,\"\n",
      "b'The youngest of them all; with him I fought,'\n",
      "b\"And Pallas gave the vict'ry to my arm.\"\n",
      "b'Him there I slew, the tallest, strongest man;'\n",
      "b'For many another there beside him lay.'\n",
      "b'Would that my youth and strength were now the same;'\n",
      "b'Then soon should Hector of the glancing helm'\n",
      "b'A willing champion find; but ye, of Greece'\n",
      "b'The foremost men, with Hector fear to fight.\"'\n",
      "b'The old man spoke reproachful; at his words'\n",
      "b'Up rose nine warriors: far before the rest,'\n",
      "b'The monarch Agamemnon, King of men;'\n",
      "b\"Next Tydeus' son, the valiant Diomed;\"\n",
      "b\"The two Ajaces, cloth'd with courage high;\"\n",
      "b'Idomeneus, and of Idomeneus'\n",
      "b'The faithful follower, brave Meriones,'\n",
      "b\"Equal in fight to blood-stain'd Mars; with these\"\n",
      "b\"Eurypylus, Euaemon's noble son;\"\n",
      "b\"Thoas, Andraemon's son; Ulysses last:\"\n",
      "b\"These all with Hector offer'd to contend.\"\n",
      "b'Then thus again Gerenian Nestor spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Shake then the lots; on whomsoe\\'er it fall,'\n",
      "b'Great profit shall he bring to Grecian arms,'\n",
      "b'Great glory to himself, if he escape'\n",
      "b'Unwounded from the deadly battle strife.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said: each mark'd his sev'ral lot, and all\"\n",
      "b\"Together threw in Agamemnon's helm.\"\n",
      "b\"The crowd, with hands uplifted, pray'd the Gods,\"\n",
      "b'And looking heav\\'nward, said, \"Grant, Father Jove,'\n",
      "b\"The lot on Ajax, or on Tydeus' son,\"\n",
      "b'Or on Mycenae\\'s wealthy King may fall.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus they: then aged Nestor shook the helm,'\n",
      "b'And forth, according to their wish, was thrown'\n",
      "b'The lot of Ajax; then from left to right'\n",
      "b\"A herald show'd to all the chiefs of Greece,\"\n",
      "b'In turn, the token; they who knew it not,'\n",
      "b\"Disclaim'd it all; but when to him he came\"\n",
      "b\"Who mark'd, and threw it in Atrides' helm,\"\n",
      "b'The noble Ajax, and, approaching, placed'\n",
      "b\"The token in his outstretch'd hand, forthwith\"\n",
      "b\"He knew it, and rejoic'd; before his feet\"\n",
      "b'He threw it down upon the ground, and said,'\n",
      "b'\"O friends, the lot is mine; great is my joy,'\n",
      "b\"And hope o'er godlike Hector to prevail.\"\n",
      "b'But now, while I my warlike armour don,'\n",
      "b\"Pray ye to Saturn's royal son, apart,\"\n",
      "b'In silence, that the Trojans hear ye not;'\n",
      "b\"Or ev'n aloud, for nought have we to fear.\"\n",
      "b'No man against my will can make me fly,'\n",
      "b'By greater force or skill; nor will, I hope,'\n",
      "b'My inexperience in the field disgrace'\n",
      "b'The teaching of my native Salamis.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus he; and they to Saturn's royal son\"\n",
      "b\"Address'd their pray'rs, and looking heav'nward, said:\"\n",
      "b'\"O Father Jove, who rul\\'st on Ida\\'s height!'\n",
      "b'Most great!  most glorious!  grant that Ajax now'\n",
      "b\"May gain the vict'ry, and immortal praise:\"\n",
      "b'Or if thy love and pity Hector claim,'\n",
      "b'Give equal pow\\'r and equal praise to both.\"'\n",
      "b'Ajax meanwhile in dazzling brass was clad;'\n",
      "b\"And when his armour all was duly donn'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Forward he mov'd, as when gigantic Mars\"\n",
      "b\"Leads nations forth to war, whom Saturn's son\"\n",
      "b\"In life-destroying conflict hath involv'd;\"\n",
      "b\"So mov'd the giant Ajax, prop of Greece,\"\n",
      "b'With sternly smiling mien; with haughty stride'\n",
      "b\"He trod the plain, and pois'd his pond'rous spear.\"\n",
      "b\"The Greeks, rejoicing, on their champion gaz'd,\"\n",
      "b\"The Trojans' limbs beneath them shook with fear;\"\n",
      "b\"Ev'n Hector's heart beat quicker in his breast;\"\n",
      "b'Yet quail he must not now, nor back retreat'\n",
      "b'Amid his comrades--he, the challenger!'\n",
      "b\"Ajax approach'd; before him, as a tow'r\"\n",
      "b\"His mighty shield he bore, sev'n-fold, brass-bound,\"\n",
      "b'The work of Tychius, best artificer'\n",
      "b'That wrought in leather; he in Hyla dwelt.'\n",
      "b\"Of sev'n-fold hides the pond'rous shield was wrought\"\n",
      "b\"Of lusty bulls; the eighth was glitt'ring brass.\"\n",
      "b'This by the son of Telamon was borne'\n",
      "b'Before his breast; to Hector close he came,'\n",
      "b'And thus with words of haughty menace spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Hector, I now shall teach thee, man to man,'\n",
      "b'The mettle of the chiefs we yet possess,'\n",
      "b'Although Achilles of the lion heart,'\n",
      "b'Mighty in battle, be not with us still;'\n",
      "b'He by his ocean-going ships indeed'\n",
      "b'Against Atrides nurses still his wrath;'\n",
      "b'Yet are there those who dare encounter thee,'\n",
      "b'And not a few; then now begin the fight.\"'\n",
      "b'To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:'\n",
      "b'\"Ajax, brave leader, son of Telamon,'\n",
      "b'Deal not with me as with a feeble child,'\n",
      "b\"Or woman, ign'rant of the ways of war;\"\n",
      "b'Of war and carnage every point I know;'\n",
      "b'And well I know to wield, now right, now left,'\n",
      "b\"The tough bull's-hide that forms my stubborn targe:\"\n",
      "b'Well know I too my fiery steeds to urge,'\n",
      "b'And raise the war-cry in the standing fight.'\n",
      "b'But not in secret ambush would I watch,'\n",
      "b'To strike, by stealth, a noble foe like thee;'\n",
      "b'But slay thee, if I may, in open fight.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and, poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear;\"\n",
      "b\"The brazen cov'ring of the shield it struck,\"\n",
      "b\"The outward fold, the eighth, above the sev'n\"\n",
      "b\"Of tough bull's-hide; through six it drove its way\"\n",
      "b\"With stubborn force; but in the seventh was stay'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Then Ajax hurl'd in turn his pond'rous spear,\"\n",
      "b\"And struck the circle true of Hector's shield;\"\n",
      "b\"Right thro' the glitt'ring shield the stout spear pass'd,\"\n",
      "b\"And thro' the well-wrought breastplate drove its way;\"\n",
      "b'And, underneath, the linen vest it tore;'\n",
      "b\"But Hector, stooping, shunn'd the stroke of death.\"\n",
      "b'Withdrawing then their weapons, each on each'\n",
      "b'They fell, like lions fierce, or tusked boars,'\n",
      "b'In strength the mightiest of the forest beasts.'\n",
      "b'Then Hector fairly on the centre struck'\n",
      "b'The stubborn shield; yet drove not through the spear;'\n",
      "b\"For the stout brass the blunted point repell'd.\"\n",
      "b'But Ajax, with a forward bound, the shield'\n",
      "b\"Of Hector pierc'd; right through the weapon pass'd;\"\n",
      "b\"Arrested with rude shock the warrior's course,\"\n",
      "b\"And graz'd his neck, that spouted forth the blood.\"\n",
      "b'Yet did not Hector of the glancing helm'\n",
      "b'Flinch from the contest: stooping to the ground,'\n",
      "b\"With his broad hand a pond'rous stone he seiz'd,\"\n",
      "b\"That lay upon the plain, dark, jagg'd, and huge,\"\n",
      "b\"And hurl'd against the sev'n-fold shield, and struck\"\n",
      "b'Full on the central boss; loud rang the brass:'\n",
      "b\"Then Ajax rais'd a weightier mass of rock\"\n",
      "b'And sent it whirling, giving to his arm'\n",
      "b\"Unmeasur'd impulse; with a millstone's weight\"\n",
      "b\"It crush'd the buckler; Hector's knees gave way;\"\n",
      "b\"Backward he stagger'd, yet upon his shield\"\n",
      "b\"Sustain'd, till Phoebus rais'd him to his feet.\"\n",
      "b\"Now had they hand to hand with swords engag'd,\"\n",
      "b'Had not the messengers of Gods and men,'\n",
      "b\"The heralds, interpos'd; the one for Troy,\"\n",
      "b'The other umpire for the brass-clad Greeks,'\n",
      "b\"Talthybius and Idaeus, well approv'd.\"\n",
      "b'Between the chiefs they held their wands, and thus'\n",
      "b\"Idaeus both with prudent speech address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"No more, brave youths! no longer wage the fight:'\n",
      "b'To cloud-compelling Jove ye both are dear,'\n",
      "b'Both valiant spearmen; that, we all have seen.'\n",
      "b'Night is at hand; behoves us yield to night.\"'\n",
      "b\"Whom answer'd thus the son of Telamon:\"\n",
      "b'\"Idaeus, bid that Hector speak those words:'\n",
      "b\"He challeng'd all our chiefs; let him begin:\"\n",
      "b'If he be willing, I shall not refuse.\"'\n",
      "b'To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:'\n",
      "b'\"Ajax, since God hath giv\\'n thee size, and strength,'\n",
      "b'And skill; and with the spear, of all the Greeks'\n",
      "b'None is thine equal; cease we for to-day'\n",
      "b\"The fight; hereafter we may meet, and Heav'n\"\n",
      "b\"Decide our cause, and one with vict'ry crown.\"\n",
      "b'Night is at hand; behoves us yield to night.'\n",
      "b'So by the ships shalt thou rejoice the Greeks,'\n",
      "b'And most of all, thy comrades and thy friends;'\n",
      "b\"And so shall I, in Priam's royal town,\"\n",
      "b\"Rejoice the men of Troy, and long-rob'd dames,\"\n",
      "b\"Who shall with grateful pray'rs the temples throng.\"\n",
      "b'But make we now an interchange of gifts,'\n",
      "b'That both the Trojans and the Greeks may say,'\n",
      "b\"'On mortal quarrel did those warriors meet,\"\n",
      "b'Yet parted thence in friendly bonds conjoin\\'d.\\'\"'\n",
      "b'This said, a silver-studded sword he gave,'\n",
      "b'With scabbard and with well-cut belt complete;'\n",
      "b'Ajax a girdle, rich with crimson dye.'\n",
      "b'They parted; Ajax to the Grecian camp,'\n",
      "b\"And Hector to the ranks of Troy return'd:\"\n",
      "b'Great was the joy when him they saw approach,'\n",
      "b\"Alive and safe; escap'd from Ajax' might\"\n",
      "b\"And arm invincible; and tow'rd the town\"\n",
      "b\"They led him back, beyond their hope preserv'd;\"\n",
      "b\"While to Atrides' tent the well-greav'd Greeks\"\n",
      "b\"Led Ajax, glorying in his triumph gain'd.\"\n",
      "b\"But when to Agamemnon's tents they came,\"\n",
      "b\"The King of men to Saturn's royal son\"\n",
      "b'A bullock slew, a male of five years old;'\n",
      "b\"The carcase then they flay'd; and cutting up,\"\n",
      "b\"Sever'd the joints; then fixing on the spits,\"\n",
      "b'Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew.'\n",
      "b\"Their labours ended, and the feast prepar'd,\"\n",
      "b\"They shar'd the social meal, nor lack'd there aught.\"\n",
      "b\"To Ajax then the chine's continuous length,\"\n",
      "b\"As honour's meed, the mighty monarch gave.\"\n",
      "b'The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,'\n",
      "b\"The aged Nestor first his mind disclos'd;\"\n",
      "b'He who, before, the sagest counsel gave,'\n",
      "b'Now thus with prudent speech began, and said:'\n",
      "b'\"Atrides, and ye other chiefs of Greece,'\n",
      "b\"Since many a long-hair'd Greek hath fall'n in fight,\"\n",
      "b\"Whose blood, beside Scamander's flowing stream,\"\n",
      "b'Fierce Mars has shed, while to the viewless shades'\n",
      "b'Their spirits are gone, behoves thee with the morn'\n",
      "b'The warfare of the Greeks to intermit:'\n",
      "b'Then we, with oxen and with mules, the dead'\n",
      "b'From all the plain will draw; and, from the ships'\n",
      "b\"A little space remov'd, will burn with fire:\"\n",
      "b'That we, returning to our native land,'\n",
      "b\"May to their children bear our comrades' bones.\"\n",
      "b'Then will we go, and on the plain erect'\n",
      "b'Around the pyre one common mound for all;'\n",
      "b\"Then quickly build before it lofty tow'rs\"\n",
      "b\"To screen both ships and men; and in the tow'rs\"\n",
      "b'Make ample portals, with well-fitting gates,'\n",
      "b'That through the midst a carriage-way may pass:'\n",
      "b'And a deep trench around it dig, to guard'\n",
      "b'Both men and chariots, lest on our defence'\n",
      "b'The haughty Trojans should too hardly press.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and all the Kings his words approv'd.\"\n",
      "b\"Meanwhile, on Ilium's height, at Priam's gate\"\n",
      "b'The Trojan chiefs a troubled council held;'\n",
      "b\"Which op'ning, thus the sage Antenor spoke:\"\n",
      "b'\"Hear now, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies,'\n",
      "b'The words I speak, the promptings of my soul.'\n",
      "b'Back to the sons of Atreus let us give'\n",
      "b'The Argive Helen, and the goods she brought;'\n",
      "b'For now in breach of plighted faith we fight:'\n",
      "b'Nor can I hope, unless to my advice'\n",

      "b'Thus having said, he sat; and next arose'\n",
      "b\"The godlike Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord;\"\n",

      "b'\"Hostile to me, Antenor, is thy speech;'\n",
      "b'Thy better judgment better counsel knows;'\n",
      "b'But if in earnest such is thine advice,'\n",
      "b'Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft.'\n",
      "b'Now, Trojans, hear my answer; I reject'\n",
      "b'The counsel, nor the woman will restore;'\n",
      "b\"But for the goods, whate'er I hither brought\"\n",
      "b'To Troy from Argos, I am well content'\n",
      "b'To give them all, and others add beside.\"'\n",
      "b'This said, he sat; and aged Priam next,'\n",
      "b\"A God in council, Dardan's son, arose,\"\n",
      "b'Who thus with prudent speech began, and said:'\n",
      "b'\"Hear now, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies,'\n",
      "b'The words I speak, the promptings of my soul:'\n",
      "b'Now through the city take your wonted meal;'\n",
      "b'Look to your watch, let each man keep his guard:'\n",
      "b'To-morrow shall Idaeus to the ships'\n",
      "b'Of Greece, to both the sons of Atreus, bear'\n",
      "b'The words of Paris, cause of all this war;'\n",
      "b'And ask besides, if from the deadly strife'\n",
      "b'Such truce they will accord us as may serve'\n",
      "b'To burn the dead; hereafter we may fight'\n",
      "b'Till Heav\\'n decide, and one with vict\\'ry crown.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; and they, obedient to his word,'\n",
      "b\"Throughout the ranks prepar'd the wonted meal:\"\n",
      "b'But with the morning to the ships of Greece'\n",
      "b'Idaeus took his way: in council there'\n",
      "b\"By Agamemnon's leading ship he found\"\n",
      "b'The Grecian chiefs, the ministers of Mars:'\n",
      "b\"And 'mid them all the clear-voic'd herald spoke:\"\n",
      "b'\"Ye sons of Atreus, and ye chiefs of Greece,'\n",

      "b\"Of Menelaus, though the gen'ral voice\"\n",

      "b'To burn the dead: hereafter we may fight'\n",
      "b'Till Heav\\'n decide, and one with vict\\'ry crown.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he: they all in silence heard; at length'\n",
      "b'Uprose the valiant Diomed, and said;'\n",
      "b'\"Let none from Paris now propose to accept'\n",
      "b\"Or goods, or Helen's self; a child may see\"\n",

      "b'But for the truce, for burial of the dead,'\n",
      "b'I nought demur; no shame it is to grace'\n",
      "b\"With fun'ral rites the corpse of slaughter'd foes.\"\n",
      "b'Be witness, Jove! and guard the plighted truce.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said: and heav'nward rais'd his staff; and back\"\n",
      "b\"To Ilium's walls Idaeus took his way.\"\n",
      "b'Trojans and Dardans there in council met'\n",
      "b'Expecting sat, till from the Grecian camp'\n",
      "b'Idaeus should return; he came, and stood'\n",

      "b'The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.'\n",
      "b'In night-long slumbers lay the other chiefs'\n",

      "b\"His sandals fair; then o'er his shoulders threw,\"\n",
      "b\"Down reaching to his feet, a lion's skin,\"\n",

      "b'This could he learn, and hither scatheless bring'\n",
      "b\"His tidings, high as Heav'n in all men's mouths\"\n",
      "b'Would be his praise, and ample his reward.'\n",
      "b\"For ev'ry captain of a ship should give\"\n",
      "b'A coal-black ewe, and at her foot a lamb,'\n",
      "b'A prize beyond compare; and high should be'\n",
      "b'His place at banquets and at solemn feasts.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; but all the chiefs in silence heard;'\n",
      "b'Then rose the valiant Diomed, and said:'\n",
      "b'\"Nestor, that heart is mine; I dare alone'\n",
      "b'Enter the hostile camp, so close at hand;'\n",
      "b\"Yet were one comrade giv'n me, I should go\"\n",

      "b\"The better course; and ev'n though one alone\"\n",
      "b'The readiest way discover, yet would be'\n",
      "b'His judgment slower, his decision less.\"'\n",
      "b'He said, and many chiefs to Diomed'\n",
      "b\"Proffer'd companionship; stood forth at once,\"\n",
      "b'With him to penetrate the Trojan camp,'\n",
      "b'The two Ajaces, ministers of Mars;'\n",
      "b'Stood forth Meriones, and eagerly'\n",
      "b\"Stood forth the son of Nestor; Atreus' son,\"\n",
      "b'The royal Menelaus, spearman bold,'\n",
      "b'And stout Ulysses, whose enduring heart'\n",
      "b\"For ev'ry deed of valour was prepar'd.\"\n",
      "b'Rose Agamemnon, King of men, and said:'\n",
      "b'\"Tydides, comrade dearest to my soul,'\n",

      "b'To persons leave the better man behind,'\n",
      "b\"And take the worse; nor def'rence show to rank,\"\n",
      "b'Not though the purest royal blood were his.\"'\n",
      "b'In fear for Menelaus thus he spoke:'\n",
      "b\"Then answer'd valiant Diomed, and said;\"\n",
      "b'\"If my companion I may freely choose,'\n",
      "b'How can I pass the sage Ulysses by?'\n",
      "b\"Of ready wit, and dauntless courage, prov'd\"\n",
      "b\"In ev'ry danger; and to Pallas dear.\"\n",
      "b'I should not fear, by him accompanied,'\n",
      "b'To pass through fire, and safely both return;'\n",
      "b'So far in prudence he surpasses all.\"'\n",

      "b\"Bestow on me, nor censure; for thou speak'st\"\n",
      "b'To those who know me all for what I am.'\n",

      "b\"The stars are high in Heav'n; and of the night\"\n",
      "b'Two thirds are spent, one third alone remains.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and both prepar'd to don their arms.\"\n",
      "b'The youthful warrior Thrasymedes gave'\n",
      "b\"To Diomed a two-edg'd sword (his own\"\n",
      "b'Had in the ship been left) and ample shield;'\n",
      "b\"Then on his brows a leathern headpiece plac'd,\"\n",
      "b'Without or peak or plume; a simple casque,'\n",
      "b'Such as is worn by youths to guard their head.'\n",
      "b\"A bow, and well-fill'd quiver, and a sword,\"\n",
      "b'Meriones to sage Ulysses gave;'\n",
      "b\"And on his brows a leathern headpiece plac'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Well wrought within, with num'rous straps secur'd,\"\n",

      "b'This from Amyntor, son of Ormenus,'\n",
      "b'Autolycus from Eleon bore away,'\n",
      "b\"Spoil of his pillag'd house; Autolycus\"\n",
      "b'Gave to Amphidamas, Cytheran chief,'\n",
      "b'Who in Scandea dwelt; Amphidamas'\n",
      "b'To Molus, pledge of friendship; he again'\n",

      "b'Thus with accoutrements and arms supplied,'\n",
      "b'They left their brother chiefs, and took their way.'\n",
      "b'Then close beside their path, by Pallas sent,'\n",
      "b'Rose, on the right, a heron; through the gloom'\n",
      "b'They saw it not indeed, but heard the cry.'\n",
      "b\"The fav'ring sign with joy Ulysses hail'd,\"\n",
      "b'And thus to Pallas pray\\'d: \"Hear me, thou child'\n",
      "b'Of aegis-bearing Jove, who still hast stood'\n",
      "b\"In ev'ry peril at my side, whose eye\"\n",
      "b\"My ev'ry movement sees; now, Goddess, now\"\n",
      "b\"Befriend me; grant that safe, with triumph crown'd,\"\n",
      "b\"We may return, some great exploit achiev'd,\"\n",
      "b'Such as the Trojans long may bear in mind.\"'\n",
      "b\"Him following, thus the brave Tydides pray'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"My voice too, child of Jove, undaunted, hear;'\n",
      "b'And be with me, as with my father erst,'\n",
      "b'The godlike Tydeus, when to Thebes he went,'\n",
      "b'An envoy, in advance; and left behind,'\n",
      "b\"Upon Asopus' banks the mail-clad Greeks.\"\n",
      "b'Smooth was the message which to Thebes he bore;'\n",
      "b'But great, his mission ended, were the deeds'\n",
      "b'That with thine aid he wrought; for, Goddess, thou'\n",
      "b'Wast with him, and thine arm was his defence:'\n",
      "b'So be thou now with me, and me defend.'\n",
      "b'Then on thine altar will I sacrifice'\n",
      "b\"A yearling heifer, broad of brow, untam'd,\"\n",
      "b'Whereon no yoke hath mortal ever laid:'\n",
      "b'Her will I give, and tip her horns with gold.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus as they pray'd, their pray'r the Goddess heard;\"\n",
      "b\"Then, their devotions ended, on they far'd\"\n",
      "b'Through the deep dead of night, like lions twain,'\n",
      "b\"'Mid slaughter, corpses, arms, and blacken'd gore.\"\n",
      "b'Nor, in the Trojan camp, did Hector leave'\n",
      "b\"The chiefs to rest; but all to conf'rence call'd,\"\n",
      "b'The leaders and the councillors of Troy;'\n",
      "b\"To whom his prudent speech he thus address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Who is there here, that for a rich reward'\n",

      "b'Subdued and vanquished, meditate retreat,'\n",
      "b'And, worn with toil, the nightly watch neglect.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus Hector spoke; but all in silence heard.'\n",
      "b'There was one Dolon in the Trojan camp,'\n",
      "b\"The herald's son, Eumedes; rich in gold\"\n",
      "b'And brass; not fair of face, but swift of foot;'\n",
      "b'Amid five sisters he the only son;'\n",
      "b'Who thus to Hector and the Trojans spoke:'\n",

      "b'But hold thou forth thy royal staff, and swear'\n",

      "b'Not vain shall be my errand, nor deceive'\n",

      "b\"To Agamemnon's tent, where all the chiefs\"\n",
      "b'Debate in council, or to fight or fly.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; and Hector took his royal staff,'\n",
      "b'And swore to him: \"Be witness Jove himself,'\n",
      "b'The Lord of thunder, that no Trojan man,'\n",
      "b\"Thyself except, shall e'er those horses drive;\"\n",
      "b'For thee they are reserv\\'d, a glorious prize.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus Hector swore; though unfulfill'd the oath.\"\n",
      "b'The hope to Dolon fresh assurance gave.'\n",
      "b'Forthwith, his bow across his shoulders slung,'\n",
      "b\"A grisly wolf-skin o'er it, on his head\"\n",
      "b\"A cap of marten's fur, and in his hand\"\n",
      "b\"A jav'lin, from the camp he took his way,\"\n",
      "b'Straight to the Grecian ships; but never thence'\n",
      "b\"Destin'd to bring th' expected tidings back.\"\n",
      "b'The crowd of men and horses left behind,'\n",
      "b\"Briskly he mov'd along; Ulysses first\"\n",
      "b\"Mark'd his approach, and to Tydides said:\"\n",
      "b'\"See, from the camp where some one this way comes,'\n",
      "b'With what intent I know not; if to play'\n",
      "b'The spy about the ships, or rob the dead.'\n",
      "b'Turn we aside, and let him pass us by'\n",
      "b'A little way; we then with sudden rush'\n",
      "b'May seize him; or if he outstrip us both'\n",
      "b\"By speed of foot, may urge him tow'rd the ships,\"\n",

      "b\"Within a spear's length when they came, or less,\"\n",
      "b\"For foes he knew them, and to night address'd\"\n",

      "b\"And as two hounds, well practis'd in the chase,\"\n",
      "b\"With glist'ning fangs, unflagging, strain to catch,\"\n",
      "b'In woodland glade, some pricket deer, or hare,'\n",

      "b'Then softly whistling to Tydides gave'\n",

      "b'The arrow drew; whereat sharp anguish shot'\n",

      "b'Surrounded by the Trojan host they found,'\n",
      "b'As hungry jackals on the mountain side'\n",

      "b'The warlike Menelaus led him forth,'\n",
      "b'Till his attendant with his car drew near.'\n",
      "b'Then Ajax, on the Trojans springing, slew'\n",

      "b\"Lest he, as back the line of battle roll'd,\"\n",
      "b'Might to the foe be left; to Nestor then'\n",
      "b\"Idomeneus address'd his speech, and said:\"\n",

      "b\"So rag'd, like blazing fire, the furious fight.\"\n",
      "b\"Meanwhile the mares of Neleus, drench'd with sweat,\"\n",

      "b'Washing away the deep foundations, laid,'\n",

      "b'Such were, in future days, to be the works'\n",

      "b\"Subdued, the Greeks beside their ships were hemm'd,\"\n",
      "b\"By Hector scar'd, fell minister of Dread,\"\n",

      "b\"Then Hector, stooping, seiz'd a pond'rous stone\"\n",

      "b\"A brass-tipp'd arrow from his bow he sent.\"\n",
      "b\"A certain man there was, Euchenor nam'd,\"\n",
      "b'Who dwelt in Corinth; rich, of blameless life,'\n",
      "b'The son of Polyeidus, skilful seer:'\n",
      "b\"His fate well knowing, he embark'd; for oft\"\n",
      "b'The good old man had told him that his doom'\n",

      "b'Him Paris smote between the ear and jaw;'\n",
      "b\"Swift fled his spirit, and darkness clos'd his eyes.\"\n",

      "b\"There beach'd beside the hoary sea, the ships\"\n",
      "b'Of Ajax and Protesilaus lay;'\n",
      "b'There had the wall been lowest built; and there'\n",

      "b'Horses and men: the stout Boeotians there,'\n",
      "b\"Join'd to th' Ionians with their flowing robes,\"\n",
      "b'Loerians, and Phthians, and Epeians proud,'\n",
      "b'Could scarce protect their ships; nor could repel'\n",

      "b'But as on fallow-land with one accord,'\n",
      "b'Two dark-red oxen drag the well-wrought plough,'\n",
      "b'Streaming with sweat that gathers round their horns;'\n",

      "b\"No Locrians follow'd; theirs were not the hearts\"\n",

      "b'Nor had they brass-bound helms, with horsehair plume,'\n",
      "b'Nor ample shields they bore, nor ashen spear;'\n",
      "b'But came to Troy, in bows and twisted slings'\n",
      "b'Of woollen cloth confiding; and from these'\n",
      "b\"Their bolts quick-show'ring, broke the Trojan ranks.\"\n",
      "b\"While those, in front, in glitt'ring arms oppos'd\"\n",
      "b'The men of Troy, by noble Hector led:'\n",

      "b'Then had the Trojans from the ships and tents'\n",
      "b\"Back to the breezy heights of Troy been driv'n\"\n",
      "b'In flight disastrous; but Polydamas'\n",
      "b\"Drew near to Hector, and address'd him thus:\"\n",
      "b'\"Hector, I know thee, how unapt thou art'\n",
      "b'To hearken to advice; because the Gods'\n",
      "b\"Have giv'n thee to excel in warlike might,\"\n",

      "b'Yet every gift thou canst not so combine:'\n",
      "b'To one the Gods have granted warlike might,'\n",
      "b'To one the dance, to one the lyre and song;'\n",
      "b\"While in another's breast all-seeing Jove\"\n",

      "b'Discerning, for the common good of all:'\n",
      "b\"By him are states preserv'd; and he himself\"\n",
      "b'Best knows the value of the precious gift.'\n",
      "b'Then hear what seems to me the wisest course.'\n",
      "b\"On ev'ry side the circling ring of war\"\n",
      "b'Is blazing all around thee; and, thou seest,'\n",
      "b\"Our valiant Trojans, since the wall they scal'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Or stand aloof, or scatter'd 'mid the ships\"\n",
      "b\"Outnumber'd, with superior forces strive.\"\n",
      "b'Then thou, retiring, hither call the chiefs;'\n",
      "b'Here take we counsel fully, if to fall'\n",
      "b\"Upon their well-mann'd ships, should Heaven vouchsafe\"\n",

      "b\"At sound of Hector's voice, round Panthous' son,\"\n",

      "b'But, to the leftward of the bloody fray,'\n",
      "b\"The godlike Paris, fair-hair'd Helen's Lord,\"\n",
      "b'Cheering his comrades to the fight, he found,'\n",

      "b'They, as reliefs, but yestermorn had come;'\n",
      "b\"Impell'd by Jove, they sought the battle field.\"\n",
      "b\"Onward they dash'd, impetuous as the rush\"\n",

      "b'Uprooted, prostrate lies some forest oak;'\n",
      "b\"The sulph'rous vapour taints the air; appall'd,\"\n",
      "b'Bereft of strength, the near beholder stands,'\n",
      "b'And awestruck hears the thunder-peal of Jove;'\n",
      "b'So in the dust the might of Hector lay:'\n",
      "b\"Dropp'd from his hand the spear; the shield and helm\"\n",
      "b'Fell with him; loud his polished armour rang.'\n",
      "b\"On rush'd, with joyous shout, the sons of Greece,\"\n",
      "b'In hope to seize the spoil; thick flew the spears:'\n",
      "b'Yet none might reach or wound the fallen chief;'\n",
      "b\"For gather'd close around, the bravest all,\"\n",
      "b'Valiant AEneas, and Polydamas,'\n",

      "b'Broad-flowing, eddying, by immortal Jove'\n",

      "b\"And dash'd the cooling water on his brow:\"\n",
      "b\"Reviv'd, he lifted up awhile his eyes;\"\n",

      "b'Thus with triumphant boast Polydamas:'\n",
      "b'\"From the strong hand of Panthous\\' noble son'\n",
      "b'Methinks that not in vain the spear has flown:'\n",
      "b'A Greek now bears it off; and he, perchance,'\n",
      "b'May use it as a staff to Pluto\\'s realm.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he; the Greeks with pain his vaunting heard;'\n",
      "b\"But chief it rous'd the spirit within the breast\"\n",
      "b'Of Ajax Telamon, whom close beside'\n",
      "b\"The dead had fall'n; he at Polydamas,\"\n",
      "b\"Retreating, hurl'd in haste his glitt'ring spear;\"\n",

      "b'Slew the Boeotian Promachus, who fain'\n",

      "b\"He struck, and pierc'd the brain: from the tall prow\"\n",
      "b\"Backwards he fell, his limbs relax'd in death.\"\n",
      "b\"Then Ajax, shudd'ring, on his brother call'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Good Teucer, we have lost a faithful friend,'\n",

      "b'And where thy trusty bow, Apollo\\'s gift?\"'\n",
      "b'Thus Ajax; Teucer heard, and ran in haste,'\n",
      "b'And stood beside him, with his bended bow,'\n",
      "b\"And well-stor'd quiver: on the Trojans fast\"\n",
      "b\"He pour'd his shafts; and struck Pisenor's son,\"\n",
      "b'Clitus, the comrade of Polydamas,'\n",
      "b'The noble son of Panthous; he the reins'\n",
      "b\"Held in his hand, and all his care bestow'd\"\n",
      "b\"To guide his horses; for, where'er the throng\"\n",
      "b\"Was thickest, there in Hector's cause, and Troy's,\"\n",
      "b\"He still was found; but o'er him hung the doom\"\n",
      "b'Which none might turn aside; for from behind'\n",
      "b'The fateful arrow struck him through the neck;'\n",
      "b'Down from the car he fell; swerving aside,'\n",
      "b\"The startled horses whirl'd the empty car.\"\n",
      "b'Them first the King Polydamas beheld,'\n",
      "b\"And stay'd their course; to Protiaon's son,\"\n",
      "b'Astynous, then he gave them, with command'\n",
      "b'To keep good watch, and still be near at hand;'\n",
      "b\"Then 'mid the foremost join'd again the fray.\"\n",
      "b'Again at Hector of the brazen helm'\n",
      "b\"An arrow Teucer aim'd; and had the shaft\"\n",
      "b\"The life of Hector quench'd in mid career,\"\n",
      "b\"Not long the fight had rag'd around the ships:\"\n",
      "b\"But Jove's all-seeing eye beheld, who watch'd\"\n",
      "b\"O'er Hector's life, and Teucer's hopes deceiv'd.\"\n",
      "b\"The bow's well-twisted string he snapp'd in twain,\"\n",
      "b\"As Teucer drew; the brass-tipp'd arrow flew\"\n",
      "b\"Wide of the mark, and dropp'd his hand the bow.\"\n",
      "b'Then to his brother, all aghast, he cried:'\n",
      "b'\"O Heav\\'n, some God our best-laid schemes of war'\n",
      "b\"Confounds, who from my hand hath, wrench'd the bow,\"\n",
      "b\"And snapp'd the newly-twisted string, which I\"\n",
      "b'But late attach\\'d, my swift-wing\\'d shafts to bear.\"'\n",
      "b\"Whom answer'd thus great Ajax Telamon:\"\n",
      "b'\"O friend, leave there thine arrows and thy bow,'\n",
      "b\"Marr'd by some God who grudges our renown;\"\n",
      "b\"But take in hand thy pond'rous spear, and cast\"\n",
      "b'Thy shield about thy shoulders, and thyself'\n",
      "b'Stand forth, and urge the rest, to face the foe.'\n",
      "b'Let us not tamely yield, if yield we must,'\n",
      "b'Our well-built ships, but nobly dare the fight.\"'\n",
      "b'\"Thus Ajax spoke; and Teucer in the tent'\n",
      "b\"Bestowed his bow, and o'er his shoulders threw\"\n",
      "b'His fourfold shield; and on his firm-set head'\n",
      "b\"A helm he plac'd, well-wrought, with horsehair plume,\"\n",
      "b\"That nodded, fearful, o'er his brow; his hand\"\n",
      "b\"Grasp'd the firm spear, with sharpen'd point of brass:\"\n",
      "b\"Then ran, and swiftly stood by Ajax' side.\"\n",
      "b\"Hector meanwhile, who saw the weapon marr'd,\"\n",
      "b\"To Trojans and to Lycians call'd aloud:\"\n",
      "b'\"Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam\\'d'\n",
      "b'In close encounter, quit ye now like men;'\n",
      "b'Against the ships your wonted valour show.'\n",

      "b\"O'er human wars th' o'erruling hand of Jove,\"\n",
      "b'To whom he gives the prize of victory,'\n",
      "b'And whom, withholding aid, he minishes,'\n",
      "b'As now the Greeks, while we his favour gain.'\n",
      "b'Pour then your force united on the ships;'\n",
      "b'And if there be among you, who this day'\n",
      "b'Shall meet his doom, by sword or arrow slain,'\n",
      "b\"E'en let him die! a glorious death is his\"\n",
      "b'Who for his country falls; and dying, leaves'\n",
      "b\"Preserv'd from danger, children, wife, and home,\"\n",
      "b\"His heritage uninjur'd, when the Greeks\"\n",
      "b'Embarking hence shall take their homeward way.\"'\n",
      "b\"His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast.\"\n",
      "b\"Ajax, on th' other side, address'd the Greeks:\"\n",
      "b'\"Shame on ye, Greeks! this very hour decides'\n",
      "b\"If we must perish, or be sav'd, and ward\"\n",
      "b'Destruction from our ships; and can ye hope'\n",
      "b'That each, if Hector of the glancing helm'\n",
      "b'Shall burn our ships, on foot can reach his home?'\n",
      "b'Or hear ye not, how, burning to destroy'\n",
      "b'Our vessels, Hector cheers his forces on?'\n",
      "b'Not to the dance, but to the fight he calls;'\n",
      "b'Nor better counsel can for us be found,'\n",
      "b'Than in close fight with heart and hand to join.'\n",
      "b\"'Twere better far at once to die, than live\"\n",
      "b\"Hemm'd in and straiten'd thus, in dire distress,\"\n",
      "b'Close to our ships, by meaner men beset.\"'\n",
      "b\"His words fresh courage rous'd in ev'ry breast.\"\n",
      "b\"Then Hector Schedius, Perimedes' son,\"\n",
      "b\"The Thracian leader, slew; on th' other side\"\n",
      "b\"Ajax the captain of the foot o'ercame,\"\n",
      "b\"Laodamas, Antenor's noble son;\"\n",
      "b\"While of his arms Polydamas despoil'd\"\n",
      "b\"Cyllenian Otus, friend of Phyleus' son,\"\n",

      "b\"And rush'd upon him; but Polydamas,\"\n",
      "b\"Stooping, the blow evaded; him he miss'd;\"\n",
      "b\"For Phoebus will'd not Panthous' son should fall\"\n",
      "b'In the front rank contending; but the spear'\n",
      "b\"Smote Croesmus through the breast; thund'ring he fell,\"\n",

      "b\"Thy soul with anger for thy comrade fill'd.\"\n",
      "b\"A pond'rous stone he hurl'd at Sthenelas,\"\n",
      "b'Son of Ithaemenes; the mighty mass'\n",
      "b\"Fell on his neck, and all the muscles crush'd.\"\n",
      "b'Back drew great Hector and the chiefs of Troy;'\n",
      "b\"Far as a jav'lin's flight, in sportive strife,\"\n",

      "b\"Quick turning, Glaucus through the breast transfix'd;\"\n",

      "b'Nor of their wonted valour were the Greeks'\n",

      "b'Then slew Meriones a crested chief,'\n",

      "b'Onetor, of Idaean Jove the priest,'\n",

      "b'Nor might the sharpest sight Sarpedon know,'\n",
      "b'From head to foot with wounds and blood and dust'\n",
      "b\"Disfigur'd; thickly round the dead they swarm'd.\"\n",
      "b'As when at spring-tide in the cattle-sheds'\n",

      "b\"Yet is the issue in the hands of Heav'n;\"\n",
      "b'I hurl the spear, but Jove directs the blow.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and, poising, hurl'd the pond'rous spear;\"\n",
      "b\"Full on Aretus' broad-orb'd shield it struck;\"\n",
      "b\"Nor stay'd the shield its course; the brazen point\"\n",
      "b\"Drove through the belt, and in his body lodg'd.\"\n",
      "b'As with sharp axe in hand a stalwart man,'\n",
      "b'Striking behind the horns a sturdy bull,'\n",

      "b\"And quiv'ring, in his vitals deep infix'd,\"\n",
      "b\"The sharp spear soon relax'd his limbs in death.\"\n",
      "b'Then at Automedon great Hector threw'\n",
      "b\"His glitt'ring spear; he saw, and forward stoop'd,\"\n",

      "b'And, terrible as Mars, Automedon'\n",
      "b\"Stripp'd off his arms, and thus exulting cried:\"\n",

      "b\"If Pallas would the needful pow'r impart,\"\n",
      "b\"And o'er me spread her aegis, then would I\"\n",
      "b\"Undaunted for Patroclus' rescue fight,\"\n",
      "b\"For deeply by his death my heart is touch'd;\"\n",
      "b'But valiant Hector, with the strength of fire'\n",
      "b'Still rages, and destruction deals around:'\n",
      "b'For Jove is with him, and his triumph wills.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said: the blue-ey'd Goddess heard with joy\"\n",
      "b'That, chief of all the Gods, her aid he sought.'\n",
      "b'She gave fresh vigour to his arms and knees,'\n",
      "b'And to his breast the boldness of the fly,'\n",
      "b\"Which, oft repell'd by man, renews th' assault\"\n",
      "b\"Incessant, lur'd by taste of human blood;\"\n",
      "b\"Such boldness in Atrides' manly breast\"\n",
      "b\"Pallas inspir'd: beside Patroclus' corpse\"\n",
      "b\"Again he stood, and pois'd his glitt'ring spear.\"\n",
      "b'There was one Podes in the Trojan ranks,'\n",
      "b'Son of Eetion, rich, of blameless life,'\n",
      "b'Of all the people most to Hector dear,'\n",
      "b'And at his table oft a welcome guest:'\n",
      "b\"Him, as he turn'd to fly, beneath the waist\"\n",
      "b\"Atrides struck; right through the spear was driv'n;\"\n",
      "b\"Thund'ring he fell; and Atreus' son the corpse\"\n",
      "b\"Dragg'd from the Trojans 'mid the ranks of Greece.\"\n",
      "b\"Then close at Hector's side Apollo stood,\"\n",
      "b\"Clad in the form of Phaenops, Asius' son,\"\n",
      "b\"Who in Abydos dwelt; of all th' Allies\"\n",
      "b\"Honour'd of Hector most, and best belov'd;\"\n",
      "b'Clad in his form, the Far-destroyer spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Hector, what other Greek will scare thee next?'\n",
      "b\"Who shrink'st from Menelaus, heretofore\"\n",
      "b\"A warrior deem'd of no repute; but now,\"\n",

      "b'Podes, thine own good friend, Eetion\\'s son.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; dark grief o'erclouded Hector's brow,\"\n",
      "b'As to the front in dazzling arms he sprang.'\n",
      "b\"Then Saturn's son his tassell'd aegis wav'd,\"\n",
      "b\"All glitt'ring bright; and Ida's lofty head\"\n",
      "b'In clouds and darkness shrouded; then he bade'\n",
      "b'His lightning flash, his volleying thunder roar,'\n",
      "b\"That shook the mountain; and with vict'ry crown'd\"\n",
      "b'The Trojan arms, and panic-struck the Greeks.'\n",
      "b\"The first who turn'd to fly was Peneleus,\"\n",
      "b'Boeotian chief; him, facing still the foe,'\n",
      "b'A spear had slightly on the shoulder struck,'\n",
      "b'The bone just grazing: by Polydamas,'\n",

      "b\"Then Hector Leitus, Aloctryon's son,\"\n",
      "b\"Thrust thro' the wrist, and quell'd his warlike might;\"\n",
      "b\"Trembling, he look'd around, nor hop'd again\"\n",

      "b\"But, onward as he rush'd on Leitus,\"\n",
      "b'Idomeneus at Hector threw his spear:'\n",
      "b'Full on his breast it struck; but near the head'\n",
      "b\"The sturdy shaft was on the breastplate snapp'd:\"\n",
      "b\"Loud was the Trojans' shout; and he in turn\"\n",
      "b\"Aim'd at Idomeneus, Deucalion's son,\"\n",
      "b\"Upstanding on his car; his mark he miss'd,\"\n",
      "b'But Coeranus he struck, the charioteer'\n",
      "b'And faithful follower of Meriones,'\n",
      "b\"Who with him came from Lyctus' thriving town:\"\n",
      "b\"The chief had left on foot the well-trimm'd ships;\"\n",
      "b'And, had not Coeranus his car in haste'\n",
      "b\"Driv'n to the rescue, by his fall had giv'n\"\n",
      "b'A Trojan triumph; to his Lord he brought'\n",
      "b'Safety, and rescue from unsparing death;'\n",
      "b\"But fell, himself, by Hector's murd'rous hand.\"\n",
      "b'Him Hector struck between the cheek and ear,'\n",
      "b'Crashing the teeth, and cutting through the tongue.'\n",
      "b\"Headlong he fell to earth, and dropp'd the reins:\"\n",
      "b'These, stooping from the car, Meriones'\n",
      "b\"Caught up, and thus Idomeneus address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Ply now the lash, until thou reach the ships:'\n",
      "b'Thyself must see how crush\\'d the strength of Greece.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and tow'rd the ships Idomeneus\"\n",

      "b\"O Father Jove, from, o'er the sons of Greece\"\n",
      "b'Remove this cloudy darkness; clear the sky,'\n",

      "b\"Threat'ning he spoke: Achilles rais'd on high\"\n",
      "b'The Pelian spear; but, ambidexter, he'\n",
      "b\"From either hand at once a jav'lin launch'd.\"\n",
      "b\"One struck, but pierc'd not through, the mighty shield,\"\n",
      "b\"Stay'd by the golden plate, the gift of Heav'n;\"\n",
      "b\"Achilles' right fore-arm the other graz'd:\"\n",
      "b\"Forth gush'd the crimson blood; but, glancing by\"\n",
      "b'And vainly longing for the taste of flesh,'\n",
      "b\"The point behind him in the earth was fix'd.\"\n",
      "b'Then at Asteropaeus in his turn'\n",
      "b'With deadly intent the son of Peleus threw'\n",
      "b\"His straight-directed spear; his mark he miss'd,\"\n",
      "b\"But struck the lofty bank, where, deep infix'd\"\n",
      "b\"To half its length, the Pelian ash remain'd.\"\n",
      "b'Then from beside his thigh Achilles drew'\n",
      "b\"His trenchant blade, and, furious, onward rush'd;\"\n",
      "b'While from the cliff Asteropaeus strove'\n",
      "b'In vain, with stalwart hand, to wrench the spear.'\n",
      "b'Three times he shook it with impetuous force,'\n",
      "b\"Three times relax'd his grasp; a fourth attempt\"\n",
      "b'He made to bend and break the sturdy shaft;'\n",
      "b\"But him, preventing, Peleus' godlike son\"\n",
      "b'With deadly stroke across the belly smote,'\n",
      "b\"And gush'd his bowels forth; upon the ground\"\n",
      "b\"Gasping he lay, and darkness seal'd his eyes.\"\n",
      "b\"Then on his breast Achilles sprang, and stripp'd\"\n",
      "b'His armour off, and thus with vaunting speech:'\n",
      "b'\"So lie thou there! \\'tis hard for thee to fight,'\n",
      "b'Though river-born, against the progeny'\n",
      "b'Of mighty Jove; a widely-flowing stream'\n",

      "b'My high descent from Jove himself I boast.'\n",
      "b'My father Peleus, son of AEacus,'\n",

      "b'The son of Jove himself was AEacus.'\n",
      "b\"High o'er all rivers, that to th' ocean flow,\"\n",
      "b'Is Jove exalted; and in like degree'\n",
      "b\"Superior is his race in pow'r to theirs.\"\n",
      "b'A mighty River hast thou here at hand,'\n",
      "b\"If that might aught avail thee; but his pow'r\"\n",
      "b\"Is impotent to strive with Saturn's son.\"\n",
      "b'With him, not Achelous, King of streams,'\n",
      "b\"Presumes to vie; nor e'en the mighty strength\"\n",
      "b'Of deeply-flowing, wide Oceanus;'\n",
      "b'From whom all rivers, all the boundless sea,'\n",
      "b'All fountains, all deep wells derive their source;'\n",

      "b'He said, and from the cliff withdrew his spear.'\n",
      "b'Him left he lifeless there upon the sand'\n",
      "b\"Extended; o'er him the dark waters wash'd,\"\n",
      "b\"And eels and fishes, thronging, gnaw'd his flesh.\"\n",
      "b\"Then 'mid the Paeons' plumed host he rush'd,\"\n",
      "b'Who fled along the eddying stream, when him,'\n",
      "b'Their bravest in the stubborn fight, they saw'\n",
      "b\"Slain by the sword and arm of Peleus' son.\"\n",
      "b'Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew,'\n",

      "b'Had been the slaughter by Achilles wrought,'\n",
      "b'But from his eddying depths, in human form,'\n",
      "b'With wrathful tone the mighty River spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"In strength, Achilles, and in deeds of arms,'\n",
      "b'All mortals thou surpassest; for the Gods'\n",
      "b'Themselves attend thee, and protect from harm;'\n",
      "b\"If Saturn's son have given thee utterly\"\n",
      "b'The Trojans to destroy, yet, ere thou slay,'\n",
      "b\"Far from my waters drive them o'er the plain;\"\n",
      "b\"For now my lovely stream is fill'd with dead;\"\n",
      "b'Nor can I pour my current to the sea,'\n",
      "b\"With floating corpses chok'd, whilst thou pursuest\"\n",
      "b'The work of death, insatiate: stay thy hand!'\n",
      "b'With horror I behold thee, mighty chief!\"'\n",
      "b\"Whom answer'd thus Achilles, swift of foot:\"\n",
      "b'\"Be it as thou wilt, Scamander, Heav\\'n-born stream;'\n",
      "b'Yet cease I not to slay until I drive'\n",
      "b'These vaunting Trojans to their walls, and prove'\n",
      "b'The force of Hector, if, in single fight,'\n",
      "b'I be by him, or he by me, subdued.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and fiercely on the Trojans rush'd,\"\n",
      "b'A God in might! to Phoebus then his speech'\n",
      "b\"The deeply-eddying River thus address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"God of the silver bow, great son of Jove,'\n",
      "b\"Obey'st thou thus the will of Saturn's son,\"\n",
      "b\"Who charg'd thee by the Trojans still to stand,\"\n",
      "b\"And aid their cause, till ev'ning's late approach\"\n",
      "b'Should cast its shadows o\\'er the fertile earth?\"'\n",
      "b'Thus as he spoke, from off the lofty bank'\n",
      "b\"Achilles springing in mid current plung'd;\"\n",
      "b'Then high the swelling stream, tumultuous, rose'\n",
      "b'In all its angry flood; and with a roar'\n",
      "b'As of a bellowing bull, cast forth to land'\n",
      "b\"The num'rous corpses by Achilles slain;\"\n",
      "b\"And many living, in his cavern'd bed,\"\n",
      "b\"Conceal'd behind the whirling waters sav'd.\"\n",
      "b'Fierce, round Achilles, rose the boiling wave,'\n",
      "b'And on his shield descending, drove him down;'\n",
      "b\"Nor might he keep his foothold; but he grasp'd\"\n",
      "b'A lofty elm, well-grown, which from the cliff'\n",
      "b'Uprooted, all the bank had torn away,'\n",
      "b\"And with its tangled branches check'd the flow\"\n",
      "b'Of the fair river, which with all its length'\n",
      "b\"It bridg'd across; then, springing from the deep,\"\n",
      "b\"Swiftly he fled in terror o'er the plain.\"\n",
      "b\"Nor ceas'd the mighty River, but pursued,\"\n",
      "b'With darkly-ruffling crest, intent to stay'\n",
      "b\"Achilles' course, and save the Trojan host.\"\n",
      "b\"Far as a jav'lin's flight he rush'd, in speed\"\n",
      "b\"Like the dark hunter eagle, strongest deem'd,\"\n",
      "b\"And swiftest wing'd of all the feather'd race.\"\n",
      "b'So on he sped; loud rattled on his breast'\n",
      "b'His brazen armour, as before the God,'\n",
      "b\"Cow'ring, he fled; the God behind him still\"\n",
      "b\"With thund'ring sound pursued. As when a man\"\n",
      "b\"From some dark-water'd spring through trenches leads,\"\n",
      "b\"'Mid plants and gardens, th' irrigating stream,\"\n",
      "b\"And, spade in hand, th' appointed channel clears:\"\n",
      "b'Down flows the stream anon, its pebbly bed'\n",
      "b'Disturbing; fast it flows with bubbling sound,'\n",
      "b\"Down the steep slope, o'ertaking him who leads.\"\n",
      "b\"Achilles so th' advancing wave o'ertook,\"\n",
      "b'Though great his speed; but man must yield to Gods,'\n",
      "b\"Oft as Achilles, swift of foot, essay'd\"\n",
      "b'To turn and stand, and know if all the Gods,'\n",
      "b\"Who dwell in Heav'n, were leagued to daunt his soul\"\n",
      "b\"So oft the Heav'n-born River's mighty wave\"\n",
      "b\"Above his shoulders dash'd; in deep distress\"\n",
      "b\"He sprang on high; then rush'd the flood below,\"\n",
      "b'And bore him off his legs, and wore away'\n",
      "b'The soil beneath his feet; then, groaning, thus,'\n",
      "b\"As up to Heav'n he look'd, Achilles cried:\"\n",
      "b'\"O Father Jove, will none of all the Gods'\n",
      "b'In pity save me from this angry flood?'\n",
      "b'Content, thereafter, would I meet my fate.'\n",
      "b\"Of all the pow'rs of Heav'n, my mother most\"\n",
      "b\"Hath wrong'd me, who hath buoy'd me up with hope\"\n",
      "b'Delusive, that, before the walls of Troy,'\n",
      "b\"I should by Phoebus' swift-wing'd arrows fall.\"\n",
      "b\"Would that by Hector's hand 'twere mine to die,\"\n",
      "b'The bravest of their brave! a warrior so'\n",
      "b\"Were by a warrior slain! now am I doom'd\"\n",
      "b'Ignobly here to sink, the mighty flood'\n",
      "b\"O'erwhelming me, like some poor shepherd lad,\"\n",
      "b'Borne down in crossing by a wintry brook.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and quickly, cloth'd in mortal form,\"\n",
      "b\"Neptune and Pallas at his side appear'd;\"\n",
      "b'With cheering words they took him by the hand,'\n",
      "b\"And thus th' Earth-shaking God his speech began:\"\n",
      "b'\"Achilles, fear not thou, nor be dismay\\'d;'\n",
      "b\"Such pow'rful aid, by Jove's consent, we bring,\"\n",
      "b\"Pallas and I, from Heav'n; 'tis not decreed\"\n",
      "b\"That thou shouldst by the River be o'erwhelm'd;\"\n",
      "b'He shall retire ere long, and thou shalt see;'\n",
      "b'And more, if thou wilt hear, we undertake'\n",
      "b\"That from the war thine arm shall not be stay'd,\"\n",
      "b'Till thou shalt drive beneath the walls of Troy'\n",
      "b'The crowd of flying Trojans; thou thyself'\n",
      "b'Shalt Hector slay, and safe regain the ships:'\n",
      "b'Such high renown we give thee to achieve.\"'\n",
      "b\"They to the other Gods, this said, return'd;\"\n",
      "b\"He, greatly strengthen'd by the voice divine,\"\n",
      "b\"Press'd onwards to the plain; the plain he found\"\n",
      "b\"All flooded o'er; and, floating, armour fair,\"\n",
      "b'And many a corpse of men in battle slain;'\n",
      "b\"Yet onward, lifting high his feet, he press'd\"\n",
      "b\"Right tow'rd the stream; nor could the mighty stream\"\n",
      "b'Check his advance, such vigour Pallas gave;'\n",
      "b'Nor did Scamander yet his fury stay,'\n",
      "b'But fiercer rose his rage; and rearing high'\n",
      "b'His crested wave, to Simois thus he cried:'\n",
      "b'\"Dear brother, aid me with united force'\n",
      "b\"This mortal's course to check; he, unrestrain'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Will royal Priam's city soon destroy,\"\n",
      "b'Nor will the Trojans his assault endure.'\n",
      "b'Haste to the rescue then, and from their source'\n",
      "b'Fill all thy stream, and all thy channels swell;'\n",
      "b'Rouse thy big waves, and roll a torrent down'\n",
      "b'Of logs and stones, to whelm this man of might,'\n",
      "b'Who triumphs now, and bears him as a God.'\n",
      "b'Nought shall his strength or beauty then avail,'\n",
      "b'Or gallant arms, beneath the waters sunk,'\n",
      "b'Deep buried in the mud: himself will I'\n",
      "b\"In sand imbed, and o'er his corpse a pile\"\n",
      "b'Of shingly gravel heap; nor shall the Greeks'\n",
      "b\"Be able to collect his bones, encas'd\"\n",
      "b'By me so deep in slime. His monument'\n",
      "b'They here may raise; but when they celebrate'\n",
      "b'His fun\\'ral rites, no mound will he require.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; and on Achilles, from on high'\n",
      "b\"Came boiling, rushing down, with thund'ring roar,\"\n",
      "b\"With foam and blood and corpses intermix'd.\"\n",
      "b\"High rose the Heav'n-born River's darkling wave,\"\n",
      "b'And bore Achilles downward; then in fear'\n",
      "b'Lest the broad waters of the eddying stream'\n",
      "b\"Should quite o'erwhelm him, Juno cried aloud,\"\n",
      "b\"And Vulcan thus, her son, in haste address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Up, Vulcan; up, my son; for we had deem\\'d'\n",
      "b\"That eddying Xanthus stood to thee oppos'd:\"\n",
      "b'Haste thee to aid; thy fiery strength display;'\n",
      "b'While from the sea I call the stormy blast'\n",
      "b'Of Zephyr and brisk Notus, who shall drive'\n",
      "b'The raging flames ahead, and burn alike'\n",
      "b'The Trojans and their arms: do thou the while'\n",
      "b\"Burn down the trees on Xanthus' banks; himself\"\n",
      "b\"Assail with fire, nor by his honey'd words\"\n",
      "b\"Nor by his menaces be turn'd aside;\"\n",
      "b\"Nor, till thou hear my voice, restrain thy pow'r;\"\n",
      "b'Then stay the raging flames\\' unwearied course.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus Juno spoke; and Vulcan straight prepar'd\"\n",
      "b\"The heav'nly fire; and first upon the plain\"\n",
      "b\"The flames he kindled, and the dead consum'd,\"\n",
      "b'Who lay, promiscuous, by Achilles slain:'\n",
      "b\"The plain was dried, and stay'd the wat'ry flood.\"\n",
      "b'As when the breath of Boreas quickly dries'\n",
      "b\"In Autumn-time a newly-water'd field,\"\n",
      "b\"The tiller's heart rejoicing: so was dried\"\n",
      "b\"The spacious plain; then he, the dead consum'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Against the river turn'd the fiery glare:\"\n",
      "b'Burnt were the willows, elms, and tamarisk shrubs,'\n",
      "b'The lotus, and the reeds, and galingal,'\n",
      "b'Which by the lovely river grew profuse.'\n",
      "b\"The eels and fishes, 'mid the eddying whirl,\"\n",
      "b\"'Mid the clear wave were hurrying here and there,\"\n",
      "b\"In dire distress from Vulcan's fiery breath:\"\n",
      "b\"Scorch'd by the flames, the mighty River spoke:\"\n",
      "b'\"Vulcan, no God against thy pow\\'r can stand,'\n",
      "b'Nor with thy fiery flames will I contend;'\n",
      "b\"Restrain thy wrath; though Peleus' godlike son\"\n",
      "b'Should from their city drive the Trojans straight,'\n",
      "b'With rival parties what concern have I?\"'\n",
      "b\"All scorch'd he spoke; his fair stream bubbling up,\"\n",
      "b'As when a caldron on a blazing fire,'\n",
      "b\"Fill'd with the melting fat of well-fed swine,\"\n",
      "b'Boils up within, and bubbles all around,'\n",
      "b'With well-dried wood beneath, so bubbling up'\n",
      "b\"The waters of the lovely River boil'd:\"\n",
      "b\"Nor onward would he flow, but check'd his course,\"\n",
      "b\"By the hot blast o'er-borne, and fiery strength\"\n",
      "b'Of skilful Vulcan; and to Juno thus,'\n",
      "b\"Imploring, he his winged words address'd:\"\n",

      "b\"O'er all the rest, to visit with his wrath?\"\n",
      "b\"E'en less than others who the Trojans aid,\"\n",
      "b'Have I offended; yet at thy command'\n",
      "b'Will I withdraw; but bid that he too cease;'\n",
      "b'And this I swear, no Trojan more to save,'\n",
      "b'Though to devouring flames a prey, all Troy'\n",
      "b'Were blazing, kindled by the valiant Greeks.\"'\n",
      "b\"This when the white-arm'd Goddess Juno heard,\"\n",
      "b\"To Vulcan straight she thus address'd her speech:\"\n",
      "b'\"Vulcan, my glorious son, restrain thy hand:'\n",
      "b\"In mortal men's behalf, it is not meet\"\n",
      "b'To press thus hardly an Immortal God.\"'\n",
      "b\"She said, and Vulcan stay'd his fiery strength,\"\n",
      "b'And, back returning, in his wonted bed'\n",
      "b\"Flow'd the fair River. Xanthus thus subdued,\"\n",
      "b\"These two their warfare ceas'd, by Juno check'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Despite her wrath; but 'mid the other Gods\"\n",
      "b'Arose contention fierce, and discord dire,'\n",
      "b\"Their warring passions rous'd on either side.\"\n",
      "b\"With fearful crash they met: the broad Earth groan'd;\"\n",
      "b\"Loud rang the Heav'n as with a trumpet's sound:\"\n",
      "b\"Jove, on Olympus' height, the tumult heard,\"\n",
      "b\"And in his heart he laugh'd a joyous laugh,\"\n",
      "b'To see the Gods in angry battle met.'\n",
      "b'Not long they stood aloof, led on by Mars'\n",
      "b'The buckler-breaker, who to Pallas first,'\n",
      "b\"Poising his spear, his bitter speech address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"What dost thou here, thou saucy jade, to war'\n",
      "b'The Gods exciting, overbold of mood,'\n",
      "b'Led by thy haughty spirit? dost thou forget'\n",
      "b'How thou the son of Tydeus, Diomed,'\n",

      "b'Direct his aim, and aid to wound my flesh?'\n",
      "b'For all I suffer\\'d then, thou now shalt pay.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus as he spoke, he struck the tassell'd shield,\"\n",
      "b'Awful to view, which not the lightning bolt'\n",
      "b\"Of Jove himself could pierce: the blood-stain'd Mars\"\n",
      "b\"Against it thrust in vain his pond'rous spear.\"\n",
      "b\"The Goddess stoop'd, and in her ample hand\"\n",
      "b'Took up a stone, that lay upon the plain,'\n",
      "b'Dark, rugged, vast, which men of elder days'\n",
      "b'Had set to mark the limits of their land.'\n",
      "b\"Full on the neck of Mars she hurl'd the mass,\"\n",
      "b\"His limbs relaxing: o'er sev'n hundred feet\"\n",
      "b\"Prostrate he lay, his hair defil'd with dust:\"\n",
      "b'Loud rang his armour; and with scornful smile'\n",

      "b\"Him, deeply groaning, scarce to life restor'd,\"\n",
      "b\"Jove's daughter Venus taking by the hand,\"\n",
      "b\"Led from the field; which when the white-arm'd Queen\"\n",

      "b'The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and'\n",

      "b'Thus they from panic flight, like timorous fawns.'\n",
      "b'Within the walls escaping, dried their sweat,'\n",

      "b'And for the last time, to his rescue come,'\n",
      "b\"And giv'n him strength and suppleness of limb?\"\n",
      "b'Then to the crowd Achilles with his head'\n",

      "b'But stay thou here and take thy breath, while I'\n",

      "b'So Pallas spoke; and he with joy obeying,'\n",
      "b\"Stood leaning on his brass-barb'd ashen spear.\"\n",
      "b'The Goddess left him there, and went (the form'\n",
      "b'And voice assuming of Deiphobus)'\n",
      "b'In search of godlike Hector; him she found,'\n",
      "b\"And standing near, with winged words address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Sorely, good brother, hast thou been bested'\n",
      "b'By fierce Achilles, who around the walls'\n",
      "b\"Hath chas'd thee with swift foot; now stand we both\"\n",
      "b'For mutual succour, and his onset wait.\"'\n",
      "b'To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:'\n",
      "b'\"Deiphobus, of all my brothers, sons'\n",
      "b'Of Hecuba and Priam, thou hast been'\n",
      "b'Still dearest to my heart; and now the more'\n",
      "b\"I honour thee who dar'st on my behalf,\"\n",
      "b'Seeing my peril, from within the walls'\n",
      "b'To sally forth, while others skulk behind.\"'\n",
      "b\"To whom the blue-ey'd Goddess thus replied:\"\n",
      "b'\"With many pray\\'rs, good brother, both our sire'\n",
      "b\"And honour'd mother, and our comrades all\"\n",
      "b'Successively implored me to remain;'\n",
      "b\"Such fear is fall'n on all; but in my soul\"\n",
      "b'On thine account too deep a grief I felt.'\n",
      "b'Now, forward boldly! spare we not our spears;'\n",
      "b'Make trial if Achilles to the ships'\n",
      "b'From both of us our bloody spoils can bear,'\n",
      "b'Or by thine arm himself may be subdued.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus Pallas lur'd him on with treach'rous wile;\"\n",
      "b'But when the two were met, and close at hand,'\n",
      "b'First spoke great Hector of the glancing helm:'\n",
      "b'\"No more before thee, Peleus\\' son, I fly:'\n",
      "b\"Thrice have I fled around the walls, nor dar'd\"\n",
      "b\"Await thine onset; now my spirit is rous'd\"\n",
      "b'To stand before thee, to be slain, or slay.'\n",
      "b\"But let us first th' immortal Gods invoke;\"\n",
      "b'The surest witnesses and guardians they'\n",
      "b'Of compacts: at my hand no foul disgrace'\n",
      "b'Shalt thou sustain, if Jove with victory'\n",
      "b'Shall crown my firm endurance, and thy life'\n",
      "b\"To me be forfeit; of thine armour stripp'd\"\n",
      "b'I promise thee, Achilles, to the Greeks'\n",
      "b'Thy body to restore; do thou the like.\"'\n",
      "b\"With fierce regard Achilles answer'd thus:\"\n",
      "b'\"Hector, thou object of my deadly hate,'\n",
      "b\"Talk not to me of compacts; as 'tween men\"\n",
      "b'And lions no firm concord can exist,'\n",
      "b'Nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite,'\n",
      "b'But ceaseless enmity between them dwells:'\n",
      "b'So not in friendly terms, nor compact firm,'\n",
      "b'Can thou and I unite, till one of us'\n",
      "b'Glut with his blood the mail-clad warrior Mars.'\n",
      "b'Mind thee of all thy fence; behoves thee now'\n",
      "b\"To prove a spearman skill'd, and warrior brave.\"\n",
      "b'For thee escape is none; now, by my spear,'\n",
      "b\"Hath Pallas doom'd thy death; my comrades' blood,\"\n",
      "b'Which thou hast shed, shall all be now aveng\\'d.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and poising, hurl'd his weighty spear;\"\n",
      "b\"But Hector saw, and shunn'd the blow; he stoop'd,\"\n",
      "b\"And o'er his shoulder flew the brass-tipp'd spear,\"\n",
      "b\"And in the ground was fix'd; but Pallas drew\"\n",
      "b\"The weapon forth, and to Achilles' hand,\"\n",
      "b\"All unobserv'd of Hector, gave it back.\"\n",
      "b\"Then Hector thus to Peleus' matchless son:\"\n",
      "b'\"Thine aim has fail\\'d; nor truly has my fate,'\n",
      "b'Thou godlike son of Peleus, been to thee'\n",
      "b\"From Heav'n reveal'd; such was indeed thy boast;\"\n",
      "b\"But flippant was thy speech, and subtly fram'd\"\n",
      "b'To scare me with big words, and make me prove'\n",
      "b'False to my wonted prowess and renown.'\n",
      "b'Not in my back will I receive thy spear,'\n",
      "b'But through my breast, confronting thee, if Jove'\n",
      "b\"Have to thine arm indeed such triumph giv'n.\"\n",
      "b'Now, if thou canst, my spear in turn elude;'\n",
      "b'May it be deeply buried in thy flesh!'\n",
      "b'For lighter were to Troy the load of war,'\n",
      "b'If thou, the greatest of her foes, wert slain.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and poising, hurl'd his pond'rous spear;\"\n",
      "b\"Nor miss'd his aim; full in the midst he struck\"\n",
      "b\"Pelides' shield; but glancing from the shield\"\n",
      "b\"The weapon bounded off. Hector was griev'd,\"\n",
      "b'That thus his spear had bootless left his hand.'\n",
      "b'He stood aghast; no second spear was nigh:'\n",
      "b\"And loudly on Deiphobus he call'd\"\n",
      "b'A spear to bring; but he was far away.'\n",
      "b\"Then Hector knew that he was dup'd, and cried,\"\n",
      "b'\"Oh Heav\\'n! the Gods above have doom\\'d my death!'\n",
      "b\"I deem'd indeed that brave Deiphobus\"\n",
      "b'Was near at hand; but he within the walls'\n",
      "b\"Is safe, and I by Pallas am betray'd.\"\n",
      "b'Now is my death at hand, nor far away:'\n",
      "b'Escape is none; since so hath Jove decreed,'\n",
      "b\"And Jove's far-darting son, who heretofore\"\n",
      "b'Have been my guards; my fate hath found me now.'\n",
      "b'Yet not without a struggle let me die,'\n",
      "b'Nor all inglorious; but let some great act,'\n",
      "b'Which future days may hear of, mark my fall.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus as he spoke, his sharp-edged sword he drew,'\n",
      "b\"Pond'rous and vast, suspended at his side;\"\n",
      "b\"Collected for the spring, and forward dash'd:\"\n",
      "b'As when an eagle, bird of loftiest flight,'\n",
      "b'Through the dark clouds swoops downward on the plain,'\n",
      "b\"To seize some tender lamb, or cow'ring hare;\"\n",
      "b\"So Hector rush'd, and wav'd his sharp-edg'd sword.\"\n",
      "b\"Achilles' wrath was rous'd: with fury wild\"\n",
      "b\"His soul was fill'd: before his breast he bore\"\n",
      "b'His well-wrought shield; and fiercely on his brow'\n",
      "b\"Nodded the four-plum'd helm, as on the breeze\"\n",
      "b'Floated the golden hairs, with which the crest'\n",
      "b\"By Vulcan's hand was thickly interlac'd;\"\n",
      "b\"And as amid the stars' unnumber'd host,\"\n",
      "b'When twilight yields to night, one star appears,'\n",
      "b\"Hesper, the brightest star that shines in Heav'n,\"\n",
      "b\"Gleam'd the sharp-pointed lance, which in his right\"\n",

      "b'Intent, and scanning eagerly to see'\n",
      "b\"Where from attack his body least was fenc'd.\"\n",
      "b\"All else the glitt'ring armour guarded well,\"\n",
      "b\"Which Hector from Patroclus' corpse had stripp'd;\"\n",
      "b\"One chink appear'd, just where the collar-bone\"\n",
      "b'The neck and shoulder parts, beside the throat,'\n",
      "b\"Where lies expos'd the swiftest road of death.\"\n",
      "b\"There levell'd he, as Hector onward rush'd;\"\n",
      "b\"Right through the yielding neck the lance was driv'n,\"\n",
      "b\"But sever'd not the windpipe, nor destroy'd\"\n",
      "b\"His pow'r of speech; prone in the dust he fell;\"\n",
      "b\"And o'er him, vaunting, thus Achilles spoke:\"\n",

      "b'I could persuade myself to tear and eat'\n",
      "b'Thy mangled flesh; such wrongs I have to avenge,'\n",
      "b'He lives not, who can save thee from the dogs;'\n",
      "b'Not though with ransom ten and twenty fold'\n",

      "b\"No, not though Priam's royal self should sue\"\n",
      "b\"To be allow'd for gold to ransom thee;\"\n",
      "b\"No, not e'en so, thy mother shall obtain\"\n",
      "b'To lay thee out upon the couch, and mourn'\n",

      "b'To change thy purpose; iron is thy soul.'\n",
      "b'But see that on thy head I bring not down'\n",
      "b\"The wrath of Heav'n, when by the Scaean gate\"\n",
      "b\"The hand of Paris, with Apollo's aid,\"\n",
      "b'Brave warrior as thou art, shall strike thee down.\"'\n",
      "b\"E'en as he spoke, his eyes were clos'd in death;\"\n",

      "b'Jove and th\\' immortal Gods shall so decree.\"'\n",
      "b'He said, and from the corpse his spear withdrew,'\n",

      "b\"A cloud of dust the trailing body rais'd:\"\n",
      "b'Loose hung his glossy hair; and in the dust'\n",
      "b'Was laid that noble head, so graceful once;'\n",
      "b\"Now to foul insult doom'd by Jove's decree,\"\n",
      "b\"In his own country, by a foeman's hand.\"\n",
      "b'So lay the head of Hector; at the sight'\n",
      "b'His aged mother tore her hair, and far'\n",
      "b\"From off her head the glitt'ring veil she threw,\"\n",
      "b\"And with loud cries her slaughter'd son bewail'd.\"\n",
      "b\"Piteous, his father groan'd; and all around\"\n",
      "b'Was heard the voice of wailing and of woe.'\n",
      "b'Such was the cry, as if the beetling height'\n",
      "b\"Of Ilium all were smould'ring in the fire.\"\n",
      "b'Scarce in his anguish could the crowd restrain'\n",
      "b'The old man from issuing through the Dardan gates;'\n",

      "b'For he too has a father, like to me;'\n",
      "b'Peleus, by whom he was begot, and bred,'\n",
      "b'The bane of Troy; and, most of all, to me'\n",

      "b\"Yet all, though griev'd for all, I less lament,\"\n",
      "b'Than one, whose loss will sink me to the grave,'\n",
      "b\"Hector! oh would to Heav'n that in mine arms\"\n",
      "b'He could have died; with mourning then and tears'\n",
      "b'We might have satisfied our grief, both she'\n",

      "b'To place the largest caldrons on the fire,'\n",

      "b\"That by Achilles' hand, with Pallas' aid,\"\n",
      "b'Far from the bath, was godlike Hector slain.'\n",
      "b\"The sounds of wailing reach'd her from the tow'r;\"\n",
      "b\"Totter'd her limbs, the distaff left her hand,\"\n",
      "b\"And to her neat-hair'd maidens thus she spoke:\"\n",
      "b'\"Haste, follow me, some two, that I may know'\n",
      "b\"What mean these sounds; my honour'd mother's voice\"\n",
      "b'I hear; and in my breast my beating heart'\n",

      "b\"Some evil, sure, on Priam's house impends.\"\n",
      "b\"Be unfulfill'd my words! yet much I fear\"\n",

      "b\"Which ever led him from the gen'ral ranks\"\n",
      "b'Far in advance, and bade him yield to none.\"'\n",
      "b\"Then from the house she rush'd, like one distract,\"\n",
      "b'With beating heart; and with her went her maids.'\n",
      "b\"But when she reach'd the tow'r, where stood the crowd,\"\n",
      "b\"And mounted on the wall, she look'd around,\"\n",
      "b'And saw the body which with insult foul'\n",
      "b'The flying steeds were dragging towards the ships;'\n",
      "b'Then sudden darkness overspread her eyes;'\n",

      "b'Thus they throughout the city made their moan;'\n",

      "b\"But when to Agamemnon's tent they came,\"\n",
      "b\"He to the clear-voic'd heralds gave command\"\n",
      "b'An ample tripod on the fire to place;'\n",
      "b\"If haply Peleus' son he might persuade\"\n",

      "b'Their task accomplished, all had now withdrawn;'\n",
      "b\"But Peleus' son the vast assembly stay'd,\"\n",
      "b'And bade them sit; then, prizes of the games,'\n",
      "b'Tripods and caldrons from the tents he brought,'\n",
      "b'And noble steeds, and mules, and sturdy steers,'\n",

      "b'Two-handled, two and twenty measures round;'\n",
      "b'These both were for the victor: for the next,'\n",
      "b'A mare, unbroken, six years old, in foal'\n",
      "b'Of a mule colt; the third, a caldron bright,'\n",
      "b'Capacious of four measures, white and pure,'\n",

      "b'Of gold two talents; for the fifth, a vase'\n",
      "b\"With double cup, untouch'd by fire, he gave.\"\n",
      "b\"Then, standing up, he thus address'd the Greeks:\"\n",

      "b'Of him who drove them, and with water pure'\n",
      "b\"Wash'd oft their manes, and bath'd with fragrant oil.\"\n",
      "b'For him they stand and mourn, with drooping heads'\n",
      "b\"Down to the ground, their hearts with sorrow fill'd;\"\n",

      "b\"Then all at once their whips they rais'd, and urg'd\"\n",

      "b'He said; the horses, of his voice in awe,'\n",
      "b\"Put forth their pow'rs awhile; before them soon\"\n",
      "b'Antilochus the narrow pass espied.'\n",
      "b\"It was a gully, where the winter's rain\"\n",
      "b'Had lain collected, and had broken through'\n",

      "b\"Far as a discus' flight, by some stout youth,\"\n",
      "b\"That tests his vigour, from the shoulder hurl'd,\"\n",
      "b'So far they ran together, side by side:'\n",

      "b\"Should be o'erthrown, and they themselves, in haste\"\n",
      "b\"To gain the vict'ry, in the dust be roll'd.\"\n",
      "b'Then thus, reproachful, to Antilochus:'\n",

      "b\"Then up he rose, and thus the Greeks address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,'\n",
      "b'Can ye too see, or I alone, the cars?'\n",
      "b\"A diff'rent chariot seems to me in front,\"\n",
      "b\"A diff'rent charioteer; and they who first\"\n",
      "b'Were leading, must have met with some mischance.'\n",
      "b\"I saw them late, ere round the goal they turn'd,\"\n",
      "b'But see them now no more; though all around'\n",
      "b'My eyes explore the wide-spread plain of Troy.'\n",
      "b\"Perchance the charioteer has dropp'd the reins,\"\n",
      "b'Or round the goal he could not hold the mares;'\n",
      "b\"Perchance has miss'd the turn, and on the plain\"\n",
      "b'Is lying now beside his broken car,'\n",
      "b'While from the course his mettled steeds have flown.'\n",
      "b'Stand up, and look yourselves; I cannot well'\n",

      "b'The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed.\"'\n",
      "b\"Sharply Oileus' active son replied:\"\n",
      "b'\"Idomeneus, why thus, before the time,'\n",
      "b'So rashly speak? while the high-stepping steeds'\n",

      "b'Nor look they out the sharpest from thy head;'\n",
      "b'But thou art ever hasty in thy speech,'\n",

      "b\"As lightly they, high-stepping, scour'd the plain.\"\n",
      "b'Still on the charioteer the dust was flung;'\n",

      "b'But eagerly sprang forth to claim the prize;'\n",
      "b'Then to his brave companions gave in charge'\n",

      "b\"The tripod, while himself unyok'd the steeds.\"\n",
      "b'Nest came the horses of Antilochus,'\n",

      "b\"O'er Menelaus triumph'd; yet e'en so\"\n",
      "b\"Atrides' flying coursers press'd him hard;\"\n",

      "b'Whose tail, back-streaming, with the utmost hairs'\n",
      "b'Brushes the felloes; close before the wheel,'\n",
      "b'Small space between, he scours the wide-spread plain:'\n",

      "b\"Had now been his; but noble Nestor's son,\"\n",
      "b'Antilochus, stood up, his right to claim,'\n",
      "b\"And to Achilles, Peleus' son, replied:\"\n",
      "b'\"Achilles, thou wilt do me grievous wrong,'\n",
      "b'If thou thy words accomplish; for my prize'\n",
      "b\"Thou tak'st away, because mishap befell\"\n",

      "b'He surely had not thus been last of all.'\n",
      "b'But, pitying him, if so thy mind incline,'\n",
      "b'Thy tents contain good store of gold, and brass,'\n",
      "b'And sheep, and female slaves, and noble steeds;'\n",
      "b'For him, of these, hereafter mayst thou take'\n",
      "b\"A prize of higher value; or e'en now,\"\n",
      "b\"And with th' applause of all; but for the mare,\"\n",
      "b'I will not give her up; and let who will'\n",
      "b'Stand forth, my own right hand shall guard my prize.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; and smil'd Achilles swift of foot,\"\n",
      "b\"Delighted; for he lov'd the noble youth,\"\n",

      "b'\"Antilochus, if such be thy request,'\n",
      "b'That for Eumelus I should add a prize,'\n",
      "b'This too I grant thee; and to him I give'\n",

      "b\"Of brass, around whose edge is roll'd a stream\"\n",
      "b'Of shining tin; a gift of goodly price.\"'\n",
      "b'He said, and bade Automedon, his friend'\n",

      "b\"He went, and brought it; in Eumelus' hand\"\n",
      "b\"He plac'd it; he with joy the gift receiv'd.\"\n",
      "b'Then Menelaus, sad at heart, arose,'\n",
      "b'Burning with wrath against Antilochus;'\n",
      "b\"And while the herald in the monarch's hand\"\n",
      "b\"His royal sceptre plac'd, and bade the Greeks\"\n",
      "b'Keep silence, thus the godlike hero spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Antilochus, till now reputed wise,'\n",
      "b\"What hast thou done? thou hast impugn'd my skill,\"\n",
      "b\"And sham'd my horses, who hast brought thine own,\"\n",
      "b'Inferior far, before them to the goal.'\n",
      "b'But come, ye chiefs and councillors of Greece,'\n",
      "b\"Judge ye between us, fav'ring neither side:\"\n",
      "b'That none of all the brass-clad Greeks may say'\n",
      "b'That Menelaus hath by false reports'\n",
      "b\"O'erborne Antilochus, and holds his prize:\"\n",
      "b'His horses fairly worsted, and himself'\n",
      "b\"Triumphant only by superior pow'r.\"\n",
      "b'Or come now, I myself will judgment give;'\n",
      "b'Nor deem I any Greek will find to blame'\n",
      "b\"In my decision, for 'tis fair and just.\"\n",
      "b'Antilochus, come forward, noble chief;'\n",
      "b\"And standing, as 'tis meet, before the car\"\n",
      "b'And horses, in thy hand the slender whip'\n",
      "b\"Wherewith thou drov'st, upon the horses lay\"\n",
      "b'Thy hand, and by Earth-shaking Neptune swear'\n",
      "b'That not of malice, and by set design,'\n",
      "b'Thou didst by fraud impede my chariot\\'s course.\"'\n",
      "b'To whom Antilochus with prudent speech:'\n",
      "b'\"Have patience with me yet; for I, O King,'\n",
      "b'O Menelaus, am thy junior far;'\n",
      "b'My elder and superior thee I own.'\n",

      "b'How quick in temper, and in judgment weak.'\n",
      "b'Set then thy heart at ease; the mare I won'\n",
      "b'I freely give; and if aught else of mine'\n",
      "b'Thou shouldst desire, would sooner give it all,'\n",
      "b\"Than all my life be low'r'd, illustrious King,\"\n",
      "b'In thine esteem, and sin against the Gods.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus saying, noble Nestor's son led forth,\"\n",
      "b\"And plac'd in Menelaus' hands the mare:\"\n",
      "b\"The monarch's soul was melted, like the dew\"\n",
      "b'Which glitters on the ears of growing corn,'\n",
      "b\"That bristle o'er the plain; e'en so thy soul,\"\n",
      "b'O Menelaus, melted at his speech;'\n",
      "b\"To whom were thus address'd thy winged words:\"\n",
      "b'\"Antilochus, at once I lay aside'\n",
      "b'My anger; thou art prudent, and not apt'\n",
      "b'To be thus led astray; but now thy youth'\n",

      "b\"By trick'ry o'er thine elders to prevail.\"\n",
      "b'To any other man of all the Greeks'\n",

      "b\"Of gold two talents, to the fourth assign'd,\"\n",

      "b'For age with heavy hand hath bow\\'d thee down.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said, and plac'd it in his hand; th' old man\"\n",
      "b\"Beceiv'd with joy the gift, and thus replied:\"\n",
      "b'\"All thou hast said, my son, is simple truth:'\n",
      "b'No firmness now my limbs and feet retain,'\n",
      "b'Nor can my arms with freedom, as of old,'\n",

      "b'Iphiclus I outran, though fleet of foot;'\n",
      "b'In hurling with the spear, with Phyleus strove,'\n",

      "b'The sons of Actor in the chariot-race'\n",
      "b\"Alone o'ercame me; as in number more,                           \"\n",

      "b'This contest to reward, the richest prize.'\n",
      "b'They were twin brothers; one who held the reins,'\n",

      "b\"Thus spoke Achilles: they his words obey'd,\"\n",
      "b\"And brushing off the dust, their garments donn'd.\"\n",
      "b'The prizes of the runners, swift of foot,'\n",
      "b'Achilles next set forth; a silver bowl,'\n",
      "b'Six measures its content, for workmanship'\n",
      "b\"Unmatch'd on earth, of Sidon's costliest art\"\n",
      "b\"The product rare; thence o'er the misty sea\"\n",
      "b\"Brought by Phoenicians, who, in port arriv'd,\"\n",
      "b'Gave it to Thoas; by Euneus last,'\n",
      "b'The son of Jason, to Patroclus paid,'\n",
      "b\"In ransom of Lycaon, Priam's son;\"\n",
      "b\"Which now Achilles, on his friend's behalf,\"\n",
      "b\"Assign'd as his reward, whoe'er should prove\"\n",
      "b'The lightest foot, and speediest in the race.'\n",
      "b\"A steer, well fatten'd, was the second prize,\"\n",
      "b'And half a talent, for the third, of gold.'\n",
      "b\"He rose, and to the Greeks proclaim'd aloud,\"\n",
      "b'\"Stand forth, whoe\\'er this contest will essay.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said: uprose Oileus' active son;\"\n",
      "b\"Uprose Ulysses, skill'd in ev'ry wile,\"\n",
      "b\"And noble Nestor's son, Antilochus,\"\n",
      "b\"Who all the youth in speed of foot surpass'd.\"\n",
      "b'They stood in line: Achilles pointed out'\n",
      "b'The limits of the course; as from the goal'\n",
      "b\"They stretch'd them to the race, Oileus' son\"\n",
      "b'First shot ahead; Ulysses following close;'\n",
      "b'Nor farther than the shuttle from the breast'\n",
      "b\"Of some fair woman, when her outstretch'd arm\"\n",
      "b'Has thrown the woof athwart the warp, and back'\n",
      "b\"Withdraws it tow'rd her breast; so close behind\"\n",
      "b\"Ulysses press'd on Ajax, and his feet\"\n",
      "b'Trod in his steps, ere settled yet the dust.'\n",
      "b'His breath was on his shoulders, as the plain'\n",
      "b\"He lightly skimm'd; the Greeks with eager shouts\"\n",
      "b\"Still cheering, as he strain'd to win the prize.\"\n",
      "b\"But as they near'd the goal, Ulysses thus\"\n",
      "b\"To blue-ey'd Pallas made his mental pray'r:\"\n",
      "b'\"Now hear me, Goddess, and my feet befriend.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus as he pray'd, his pray'r the Goddess heard,\"\n",
      "b\"And all his limbs with active vigour fill'd;\"\n",
      "b\"And, as they stretch'd their hands to seize the prize,\"\n",
      "b\"Tripp'd up by Pallas, Ajax slipp'd and fell,\"\n",
      "b'Amid the offal of the lowing kine'\n",
      "b\"Which o'er Patroclus Peleus' son had slain.\"\n",
      "b\"His mouth and nostrils were with offal fill'd.\"\n",
      "b'First in the race, Ulysses bore away'\n",
      "b'The silver bowl; the steer to Ajax fell;'\n",
      "b'And as upon the horn he laid his hand,'\n",
      "b\"Sputt'ring the offal out, he call'd aloud:\"\n",
      "b'\"Lo, how the Goddess has my steps bewray\\'d,'\n",
      "b'Who guards Ulysses with a mother\\'s care.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus as he spoke, loud laugh'd the merry Greeks.\"\n",
      "b'Antilochus the sole remaining prize'\n",
      "b\"Receiv'd, and, laughing, thus the Greeks address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"I tell you, friends, but what yourselves do know,'\n",
      "b\"How of the elder men th' immortal Gods\"\n",
      "b\"Take special care; for Ajax' years not much\"\n",
      "b'Exceed mine own; but here we see a man,'\n",
      "b'One of a former age, and race of men;'\n",
      "b'A hale old man we call him; but for speed'\n",
      "b'Not one can match him, save Achilles\\' self.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus he, with praise implied of Peleus' son;\"\n",
      "b'To whom in answer thus Achilles spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Antilochus, not unobserv\\'d of me'\n",
      "b'Nor unrewarded shall thy praise remain:'\n",
      "b'To thy half talent add this second half.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus saying, in his hand he plac'd the gold;\"\n",
      "b\"Antilochus with joy the gift receiv'd.\"\n",
      "b'Next, in the ring the son of Peleus laid'\n",
      "b\"A pond'rous spear, a helmet, and a shield,\"\n",
      "b'The spoil Patroclus from Sarpedon won;'\n",
      "b\"Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"For these we call upon two champions brave'\n",
      "b\"To don their arms, their sharp-edg'd weapons grasp,\"\n",
      "b'And public trial of their prowess make;'\n",
      "b\"And he who first his rival's flesh shall reach,\"\n",
      "b'And, through his armour piercing, first draw blood,'\n",
      "b'He shall this silver-studded sword receive,'\n",
      "b'My trophy from Asteropaeus won,'\n",
      "b'Well-wrought, of Thracian metal; but the arms'\n",
      "b'In common property they both shall hold,'\n",
      "b'And in my tent a noble banquet share.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; uprose great Ajax Telamon,'\n",
      "b\"And Tydeus' son, the valiant Diomed.\"\n",
      "b\"First, from the crowd apart, they donn'd their arms;\"\n",
      "b'Then, eager for the fight, with haughty stare'\n",
      "b\"Stood in the midst; the Greeks admiring gaz'd.\"\n",
      "b'When, each approaching other, near they came,'\n",
      "b\"Thrice rush'd they on, and thrice in combat clos'd.\"\n",
      "b'Then through the buckler round of Diomed'\n",
      "b\"Great Ajax drove his spear; nor reach'd the point\"\n",
      "b\"Tydides' body, by the breastplate stay'd:\"\n",
      "b\"While, aim'd above the mighty shield's defence,\"\n",
      "b\"His glitt'ring weapon flash'd at Ajax' throat.\"\n",
      "b'For Ajax fearing, shouted then the Greeks'\n",
      "b'To cease the fight, and share alike the prize;'\n",
      "b\"But from Achilles' hand the mighty sword,\"\n",
      "b\"With belt and scabbard, Diomed receiv'd.\"\n",
      "b\"Next in the ring the son of Peleus plac'd\"\n",
      "b\"A pond'rous mass of iron, as a quoit\"\n",
      "b\"Once wielded by Eetion's giant strength,\"\n",
      "b'But to the ships with other trophies borne,'\n",
      "b\"When by Achilles' hand Eetion fell.\"\n",
      "b\"Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Stand forth, whoe\\'er this contest will essay.'\n",
      "b'This prize who wins, though widely may extend'\n",
      "b'His fertile fields, for five revolving years'\n",
      "b'It will his wants supply; nor to the town'\n",
      "b'For lack of iron, with this mass in store,'\n",
      "b'Need he his shepherd or his ploughman send.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; and valiant Polypoetes rose,'\n",
      "b\"Epeius, and Leonteus' godlike strength,\"\n",
      "b'And mighty Ajax, son of Telamon.'\n",
      "b'In turns they took their stand; Epeius first'\n",
      "b\"Uprais'd the pond'rous mass, and through the air\"\n",
      "b\"Hurl'd it, amid the laughter of the Greeks.\"\n",
      "b'Next came Leonteus, scion true of Mars;'\n",
      "b'The third was Ajax; from whose stalwart hand'\n",
      "b'Beyond the farthest mark the missile flew.'\n",
      "b'But when the valiant Polypoetes took'\n",
      "b'The quoit in hand, far as a herdsman throws'\n",
      "b'His staff, that, whirling, flies among the herd;'\n",
      "b\"So far beyond the ring's extremest bound\"\n",
      "b\"He threw the pond'rous mass; loud were the shouts;\"\n",
      "b\"And noble Polypoetes' comrades rose,\"\n",
      "b\"And to the ships the monarch's gift convey'd.\"\n",
      "b\"The archers' prizes next, of iron hoar,\"\n",
      "b\"Ten sturdy axes, double-edg'd, he plac'd,\"\n",
      "b'And single hatchets ten; then far away'\n",
      "b\"Rear'd on the sand a dark-prow'd vessel's mast,\"\n",
      "b\"On which, with slender string, a tim'rous dove\"\n",
      "b\"Was fasten'd by the foot, the archers' mark;\"\n",
      "b'That who should strike the dove should to his tent'\n",
      "b'The axes bear away; but who the string'\n",
      "b'Should sever, but should fail to strike the bird,'\n",
      "b'As less in skill, the hatchets should receive.'\n",
      "b'Thus spoke Achilles; straight uprose the might'\n",
      "b'Of royal Teucer, and Meriones,'\n",
      "b'The faithful follower of Idomeneus.'\n",
      "b'They in a brass-bound helmet shook the lots.'\n",
      "b\"The first was Teucer's; with impetuous force\"\n",
      "b\"He shot; but vow'd not to the Archer-King\"\n",
      "b'Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb.'\n",
      "b'The dove he struck not, for the Archer-God'\n",
      "b'Withheld his aid; but close beside her foot'\n",
      "b\"The arrow sever'd the retaining string.\"\n",
      "b\"The bird releas'd, soar'd heav'nward; while the string\"\n",
      "b\"Dropp'd, from the mast suspended, tow'rds the earth,\"\n",
      "b'And loudly shouted their applause the Greeks.'\n",
      "b\"Then snatch'd Meriones in haste the bow\"\n",
      "b\"From Teucer's hand; his own already held\"\n",
      "b'His arrow, pointed straight; he drew the string,'\n",
      "b\"And to the far-destroying King he vow'd\"\n",
      "b'Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb.'\n",
      "b\"Aloft amid the clouds he mark'd the dove,\"\n",
      "b\"And struck her, as she soar'd, beneath the wing;\"\n",
      "b\"Right through the arrow pass'd; and to the earth\"\n",
      "b'Returning, fell beside Meriones.'\n",
      "b\"The bird upon the dark-prow'd vessel's mast\"\n",
      "b'Lighted awhile; anon, with drooping head,'\n",
      "b\"And pinions flutt'ring vain, afar she fell,\"\n",
      "b\"Lifeless; th' admiring crowd with wonder gaz'd.\"\n",
      "b'Meriones the axes bore away,'\n",
      "b'While Teucer to the ships the hatchets bore.'\n",
      "b'Last, in the ring the son of Peleus laid'\n",
      "b\"A pond'rous spear, and caldron, burnish'd bright,\"\n",
      "b\"Pric'd at an ox's worth, untouch'd by fire,\"\n",
      "b\"For those who with the jav'lin would contend.\"\n",
      "b'Uprose then Agamemnon, King of men,'\n",
      "b'The son of Atreus, and Meriones,'\n",
      "b'The faithful follower of Idomeneus:'\n",
      "b\"But Peleus' godlike son address'd them thus:\"\n",
      "b'\"How far, Atrides, thou excell\\'st us all,'\n",
      "b\"And with the jav'lin what thy pow'r and skill\"\n",
      "b'Pre-eminent, we know; take thou this prize,'\n",
      "b'And bear it to thy ships; and let us give'\n",
      "b'To brave Meriones the brazen spear;'\n",
      "b'If so it please thee, such were my advice.\"'\n",
      "b'He said; and Agamemnon, King of men,'\n",
      "b'Assenting, gave to brave Meriones'\n",
      "b\"The brazen spear; while in Talthybius' care,\"\n",
      "b\"His herald, plac'd the King his noble prize.\"\n",
      "b\"The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter\"\n",

      "b'The games were ended, and the multitude'\n",
      "b\"Amid the ships their sev'ral ways dispers'd:\"\n",
      "b'Some to their supper, some to gentle sleep'\n",
      "b'Yielding, delighted; but Achilles still'\n",

      "b'Then starting to his feet, along the shore'\n",

      "b'Nor did the morn, above the sea appearing,'\n",
      "b\"Unmark'd of him arise; his flying steeds\"\n",

      "b'To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:'\n",
      "b'\"On him, old man, nor dogs nor birds have fed,'\n",
      "b\"But by the ship of Peleus' son he lies\"\n",
      "b'Within the tent; twelve days he there hath lain,'\n",

      "b'The corpse, indeed, with each returning morn,'\n",
      "b\"Around his comrade's tomb Achilles drags,\"\n",

      "b\"From blood-stains cleans'd, and clos'd his many wounds,\"\n",

      "b'And answer\\'d, \"See, my son, how good it is'\n",
      "b\"To give th' immortal Gods their tribute due;\"\n",

      "b'But, as thy guide, I could conduct thee safe,'\n",

      "b'On ship-board or on foot; nor by the fault'\n",
      "b'Of thy conductor shouldst thou meet with harm.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus spoke the Guardian-God, and on the car'\n",
      "b'Mounting in haste, he took the whip and reins,'\n",
      "b\"And with fresh vigour mules and horses fill'd.\"\n",
      "b\"When to the ship-tow'rs and the trench they came,\"\n",
      "b'The guard had late been busied with their meal;'\n",
      "b\"And with deep sleep the heav'nly Guide o'erspread\"\n",
      "b\"The eyes of all; then open'd wide the gates,\"\n",
      "b\"And push'd aside the bolts, and led within\"\n",
      "b'Both Priam, and the treasure-laden wain.'\n",
      "b\"But when they reach'd Achilles' lofty tent,\"\n",

      "b'Sprang to the ground, and thus to Priam spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Old man, a God hath hither been thy guide;'\n",
      "b'Hermes I am, and sent to thee from Jove,'\n",
      "b'Father of all, to bring thee safely here.'\n",
      "b\"I now return, nor to Achilles' eyes\"\n",
      "b'Will I appear; beseems it not a God'\n",
      "b'To greet a mortal in the sight of all.'\n",
      "b\"But go thou in, and clasp Achilles' knees,\"\n",

      "b\"Thus saying, Hermes to Olympus' heights\"\n",
      "b\"Return'd; and Priam from his chariot sprang,\"\n",
      "b'And left Idaeus there, in charge to keep'\n",
      "b'The horses and the mules, while he himself'\n",

      "b\"Achilles, lov'd of Heav'n. The chief he found\"\n",

      "b'And standing by Achilles, with his arms'\n",
      "b\"Embrac'd his knees, and kiss'd those fearful hands,\"\n",
      "b\"Blood-stain'd, which many of his sons had slain.\"\n",
      "b'As when a man, by cruel fate pursued,'\n",
      "b\"In his own land hath shed another's blood,\"\n",

      "b\"To make my pray'r, and priceless ransom pay.\"\n",
      "b'Then thou, Achilles, reverence the Gods;'\n",
      "b\"And, for thy father's sake, look pitying down\"\n",
      "b'On me, more needing pity; since I bear'\n",
      "b'Such grief as never man on earth hath borne.'\n",
      "b'Who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son.\"'\n",
      "b\"Thus as he spoke, within Achilles' breast\"\n",
      "b\"Fond mem'ry of his father rose; he touch'd\"\n",
      "b\"The old man's hand, and gently put him by;\"\n",
      "b\"Then wept they both, by various mem'ries stirr'd:\"\n",
      "b\"One, prostrate at Achilles' feet, bewail'd\"\n",
      "b'His warrior son; Achilles for his sire,'\n",
      "b'And for Patroclus wept, his comrade dear;'\n",

      "b\"But when Achilles had indulg'd his grief,\"\n",
      "b\"And eas'd the yearning of his heart and limbs,\"\n",
      "b'Uprising, with his hand the aged sire,'\n",
      "b'Pitying his hoary head and hoary beard,'\n",
      "b\"He rais'd, and thus with gentle words address'd:\"\n",
      "b'\"Alas, what sorrows, poor old man, are thine!'\n",
      "b'How couldst thou venture to the Grecian ships'\n",
      "b'Alone, and to the presence of the man'\n",

      "b'Many and brave? an iron heart is thine!'\n",
      "b'But sit thou on this seat; and in our hearts,'\n",
      "b'Though filled with grief, let us that grief suppress;'\n",
      "b'For woful lamentation nought avails.'\n",
      "b'Such, is the thread the Gods for mortals spin,'\n",
      "b'To live in woe, while they from cares are free.'\n",
      "b'Two coffers lie beside the door of Jove,'\n",
      "b'With gifts for man: one good, the other ill;'\n",

      "b\"By God and man alike despis'd he roams.\"\n",
      "b'Thus from his birth the Gods to Peleus gave'\n",

      "b'To give thee back thy son; for here of late'\n",
      "b\"Despatch'd by Jove, my Goddess-mother came,\"\n",

      "b'I brook thee not, and Jove\\'s command transgress.\"'\n",
      "b\"He said; the old man trembled, and obey'd;\"\n",
      "b\"Then to the door-way, with a lion's spring,\"\n",
      "b\"Achilles rush'd; not unaccompanied;\"\n",
      "b'With him Automedon and Aleimus,'\n",
      "b'His two attendants, of his followers all,'\n",
      "b\"Next to the lost Patroclus, best-esteem'd;\"\n",

      "b'Two robes they left, and one well-woven vest,'\n",

      "b\"When they had wash'd the body, and with oil\"\n",
      "b\"Anointed, and around it wrapp'd the robe\"\n",
      "b'And vest, Achilles lifted up the dead'\n",
      "b'With his own hands, and laid him on the couch;'\n",

      "b'A fitting share for thee I set aside.\"'\n",
      "b\"This said, Achilles to the tent return'd;\"\n",
      "b\"On the carv'd couch, from whence he rose, he sat\"\n",
      "b'Beside the wall; and thus to Priam spoke:'\n",
      "b'\"Old man, thy son, according to thy pray\\'r,'\n",
      "b\"Is giv'n thee back; upon the couch he lies;\"\n",
      "b'Thyself shalt see him at the dawn of day.'\n",
      "b\"Meanwhile the ev'ning meal demands our care.\"\n",
      "b\"Not fair-hair'd Niobe abstain'd from food\"\n",

      "b'Herself with fair Latona to compare,'\n",
      "b\"Her many children with her rival's two;\"\n",
      "b'So by the two were all the many slain.'\n",
      "b'Nine days in death they lay; and none was there'\n",
      "b\"To pay their fun'ral rites; for Saturn's son\"\n",
      "b'Had given to all the people hearts of stone.'\n",
      "b\"At length th' immortal Gods entomb'd the dead.\"\n",
      "b'Nor yet did Niobe, when now her grief'\n",
      "b'Had worn itself in tears, from food refrain.'\n",
      "b'And now in Sipylus, amid the rocks,'\n",

      "b\"That love to dance by Achelous' stream,\"\n",
      "b\"'Tis said, were cradled, she, though turn'd to stone,\"\n",
      "b\"Broods o'er the wrongs inflicted by the Gods.\"\n",
      "b'So we too, godlike sire, the meal may share;'\n",
      "b'And later, thou thy noble son mayst mourn,'\n",
      "b'To Troy restor\\'d--well worthy he thy tears.\"'\n",
      "b\"This said, he slaughter'd straight a white-fleec'd sheep;\"\n",
      "b\"His comrades then the carcase flay'd and dress'd:\"\n",

      "b'His venerable face, and gracious speech.'\n",
      "b\"With mutual pleasure each on other gaz'd,\"\n",

      "b'They from the chamber, torch in hand, withdrew,'\n",
      "b\"And with obedient haste two beds prepar'd.\"\n",

      "b\"For godlike Hector's fun'ral rites ye need;\"\n",
      "b'That for so long a time I may myself'\n",
      "b'Refrain from combat, and the people stay.\"'\n",
      "b'To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:'\n",
      "b'\"If by thy leave we may indeed perform'\n",
      "b\"His fun'ral rites, to thee, Achilles, great\"\n",
      "b'Will be our gratitude, if this thou grant.'\n",

      "b'The Trojans well may fear to draw the wood.'\n",
      "b'Nine days to public mourning would we give;'\n",
      "b\"The tenth, to fun'ral rites and fun'ral feast;\"\n",
      "b\"Then on th' eleventh would we raise his mound;\"\n",
      "b'The twelfth, renew the war, if needs we must.\"'\n",
      "b'To whom Achilles swift of foot replied:'\n",

      "b\"Thus speaking, with his hand the old man's wrist\"\n",
      "b\"He grasp'd, in token that he need not fear.\"\n",

      "b'How from the ships in safety to conduct'\n",

      "b'Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning'\n",
      "b'him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their'\n",
      "b'voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid'\n",

      "b'and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden'\n",

      "b'Jove sends a lying dream to Agamemnon, who thereon calls the'\n",

      "b'Achaean and Trojan forces.'\n",
      "b'Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly,'\n",
      "b'but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles,'\n",
      "b'and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end he'\n",
      "b'deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon; so he'\n",
      "b'called one to him and said to it, \"Lying Dream, go to the ships of the'\n",

      "b'shall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods;'\n",
      "b'Juno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans.\"'\n",
      "b'The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the'\n",
      "b'ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found him'\n",
      "b'in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head in'\n",
      "b'the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured above'\n",
      "b'all his councillors, and said:--'\n",
      "b'\"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host'\n",
      "b'and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear'\n",
      "b'me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not'\n",
      "b'near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no'\n",
      "b'longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to'\n",
      "b'her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove.'\n",
      "b'Remember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape you.\"'\n",
      "b'The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely not'\n",
      "b'to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to take the'\n",
      "b'city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of Jove, who had'\n",
      "b'many another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans and Trojans.'\n",
      "b'Then presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his'\n",
      "b'ears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and'\n",
      "b'over this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,'\n",
      "b'and slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took'\n",

      "b'herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent the'\n",
      "b'criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and'\n",
      "b'the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of the'\n",
      "b'elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were'\n",
      "b'assembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.'\n",
      "b'\"My friends,\" said he, \"I have had a dream from heaven in the dead of'\n",
      "b\"night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. It hovered\"\n",
      "b\"over my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has\"\n",
      "b'the welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders'\n",
      "b'should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from Jove,'\n",
      "b'who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you.'\n",
      "b'He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take'\n",
      "b'Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has'\n",
      "b'brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the'\n",
      "b\"hands of Jove. Remember this.' The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let\"\n",
      "b'us now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But it will be well'\n",
      "b'that I should first sound them, and to this end I will tell them to fly'\n",
      "b'with their ships; but do you others go about among the host and prevent'\n",
      "b'their doing so.\"'\n",
      "b'He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity and'\n",
      "b'goodwill addressed them thus: \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and'\n",
      "b'councillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had told'\n",
      "b'us of this dream we should have declared it false, and would have had'\n",
      "b'nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost man among'\n",
      "b'us; we must therefore set about getting the people under arms.\"'\n",
      "b'With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred'\n",
      "b'kings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the'\n",
      "b'people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from'\n",
      "b'some hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers,'\n",
      "b'bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pour'\n",
      "b'from ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the'\n",
      "b'wide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of'\n",
      "b'Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell'\n",
      "b'of mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the'\n",
      "b'people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among them'\n",
      "b'to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at last'\n",
      "b'they were got into their several places and ceased their clamour. Then'\n",
      "b'King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the work of Vulcan,'\n",
      "b'who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer'\n",
      "b'of Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the'\n",
      "b'mighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people.'\n",
      "b'Atreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes'\n",
      "b'in his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of'\n",
      "b'all Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed'\n",
      "b'the Argives.'\n",
      "b'\"My friends,\" he said, \"heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven'\n",
      "b'has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise'\n",
      "b'that I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has'\n",
      "b'played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos'\n",
      "b'with the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid'\n",
      "b'many a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power'\n",
      "b'is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host,'\n",
      "b'at once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in'\n",
      "b'number than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think that'\n",
      "b'the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they'\n",
      "b'have each been numbered--the Trojans by the roll of their householders,'\n",
      "b'and we by companies of ten; think further that each of our companies'\n",
      "b'desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out their wine; we are so'\n",
      "b'greatly more in number that full many a company would have to go'\n",
      "b'without its cup-bearer. But they have in the town allies from other'\n",
      "b'places, and it is these that hinder me from being able to sack the rich'\n",
      "b\"city of Ilius. Nine of Jove's years are gone; the timbers of our ships\"\n",
      "b'have rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little'\n",
      "b'ones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came'\n",
      "b'hither to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say:'\n",
      "b'let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.\"'\n",
      "b'With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of them'\n",
      "b'as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to and fro'\n",
      "b'like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south winds break'\n",
      "b\"from heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over\"\n",
      "b'a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were they'\n",
      "b'swayed as they flew with loud cries towards the ships, and the dust'\n",
      "b'from under their feet rose heavenward. They cheered each other on to'\n",
      "b'draw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of'\n",
      "b'them; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the'\n",
      "b'welkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return.'\n",
      "b'Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was'\n",
      "b'not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing'\n",
      "b'Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over'\n",
      "b'the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still'\n",
      "b'keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at'\n",
      "b'Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak'\n",
      "b'fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the'\n",
      "b'sea.\"'\n",
      "b'Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the'\n",
      "b'topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing'\n",
      "b'alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved'\n",
      "b'and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, \"Ulysses, noble son of'\n",
      "b'Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off'\n",
      "b'home to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans'\n",
      "b'the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once'\n",
      "b'among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw'\n",
      "b'not their ships into the sea.\"'\n",
      "b'Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak from'\n",
      "b'him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca, who'\n",
      "b'waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went straight'\n",
      "b'up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable'\n",
      "b'staff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.'\n",
      "b'Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him'\n",
      "b'fairly. \"Sir,\" said he, \"this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand to'\n",
      "b'your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not yet'\n",
      "b'know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long will'\n",
      "b'visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us at the'\n",
      "b'council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us'\n",
      "b'a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is'\n",
      "b'with them.\"'\n",
      "b'But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he'\n",
      "b'struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, \"Sirrah, hold your'\n",
      "b'peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and no'\n",
      "b'soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all be'\n",
      "b'kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man must'\n",
      "b'be supreme--one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given the'\n",
      "b'sceptre of sovereignty over you all.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurried'\n",
      "b'back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the'\n",
      "b'thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all the'\n",
      "b'sea is in an uproar.'\n",
      "b'The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, but'\n",
      "b'Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue--a man of many'\n",
      "b'words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against all'\n",
      "b'who were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he might set'\n",
      "b'the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those that came'\n",
      "b'before Troy--bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders'\n",
      "b'rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point, but'\n",
      "b'there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses hated him'\n",
      "b'worst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle;'\n",
      "b'now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on'\n",
      "b'Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet none the less he'\n",
      "b'kept on brawling and bawling at the son of Atreus.'\n",
      "b'\"Agamemnon,\" he cried, \"what ails you now, and what more do you want?'\n",
      "b'Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever we'\n",
      "b'take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more gold,'\n",
      "b'which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or'\n",
      "b'another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl to'\n",
      "b'hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans,'\n",
      "b'should bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than'\n",
      "b'men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in'\n",
      "b'his own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to'\n",
      "b'him or no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and see how he has'\n",
      "b'treated him--robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself. Achilles'\n",
      "b'takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you would'\n",
      "b'never again insult him.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked'\n",
      "b'him sternly. \"Check your glib tongue, Thersites,\" said be, \"and babble'\n",
      "b'not a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back'\n",
      "b'you. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of'\n",
      "b'Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor keep'\n",
      "b'harping about going home. We do not yet know how things are going to'\n",
      "b'be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good success or evil.'\n",
      "b'How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so'\n",
      "b'many prizes? I tell you, therefore--and it shall surely be--that if I'\n",
      "b'again catch you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own'\n",
      "b'head and be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will take you,'\n",
      "b'strip you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly till you go'\n",
      "b'blubbering back to the ships.\"'\n",
      "b'On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till he'\n",
      "b'dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody weal on'\n",
      "b'his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as he'\n",
      "b'wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet they'\n",
      "b'laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying, \"Ulysses'\n",
      "b'has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council, but he never'\n",
      "b\"did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this fellow's mouth\"\n",
      "b'from prating further. He will give the kings no more of his insolence.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva'\n",
      "b'in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who'\n",
      "b'were far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with'\n",
      "b'all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:--'\n",
      "b'\"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all'\n",
      "b'mankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from'\n",
      "b'Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of Troy,'\n",
      "b'and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set off'\n",
      "b'homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened.'\n",
      "b'A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single'\n",
      "b'month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is'\n",
      "b'now nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore,'\n",
      "b'blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we'\n",
      "b'go home empty after so long a stay--therefore, my friends, be patient'\n",
      "b'yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of'\n",
      "b'Calchas were false or true.'\n",
      "b'\"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were'\n",
      "b'yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were'\n",
      "b'detained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam'\n",
      "b'and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain offering'\n",
      "b'hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine'\n",
      "b'plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then'\n",
      "b'we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground,'\n",
      "b'with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar'\n",
      "b'on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite'\n",
      "b'small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eight'\n",
      "b'in all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent ate'\n",
      "b'the poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting her'\n",
      "b'little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught her'\n",
      "b'by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both the'\n",
      "b'sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become a sign;'\n",
      "b'for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and we stood'\n",
      "b'there wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then, that such'\n",
      "b'a fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith'\n",
      "b\"declared to us the oracles of heaven. 'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are\"\n",
      "b'you thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and'\n",
      "b'long ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the'\n",
      "b'serpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them,'\n",
      "b'which makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the'\n",
      "b\"tenth shall take the town.' This was what he said, and now it is all\"\n",
      "b'coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take the city of'\n",
      "b'Priam.\"'\n",
      "b'On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with the'\n",
      "b'uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. \"Shame on you,\"'\n",
      "b'he cried, \"to stay talking here like children, when you should fight'\n",
      "b'like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have'\n",
      "b'taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our'\n",
      "b'drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put'\n",
      "b'our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking here'\n",
      "b'shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your'\n",
      "b'own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to battle, and leave this'\n",
      "b'handful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to'\n",
      "b'Argos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or a liar. For the'\n",
      "b'mighty son of Saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when we'\n",
      "b'Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. He'\n",
      "b'showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our right'\n",
      "b'hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first lain with'\n",
      "b'the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has'\n",
      "b'suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such'\n",
      "b'haste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may'\n",
      "b'meet his doom in the sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear'\n",
      "b'to my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly.'\n",
      "b'Divide your men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that'\n",
      "b'clans and tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and'\n",
      "b'if the Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and'\n",
      "b'peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the'\n",
      "b'other. Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of'\n",
      "b'heaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town.\"'\n",
      "b'And Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I'\n",
      "b'had among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King Priam'\n",
      "b'would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it. But the'\n",
      "b'son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife. Achilles'\n",
      "b'and I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I was the first'\n",
      "b'to offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans will not stave'\n",
      "b'off destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that'\n",
      "b'our hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the'\n",
      "b'ordering of your shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your'\n",
      "b'chariots carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we'\n",

      "b'When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about'\n",

      "b'Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus'\n",
      "b'strode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no man,'\n",
      "b'neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had'\n",

      "b'You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and'\n",

      "b'scared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and'\n",
      "b'the other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by'\n",
      "b'the hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of'\n",

      "b'So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the'\n",

      "b'and went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round'\n",
      "b'him as he fell heavily to the ground.'\n",
      "b'Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come'\n",

      "b'The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son'\n",
      "b'of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman'\n",
      "b'and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill'\n",
      "b'every kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but'\n",
      "b'neither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the'\n",

      "b'him between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he'\n",
      "b'fell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.'\n",
      "b'Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of'\n",
      "b'Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning'\n",
      "b'workmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that'\n",
      "b'made the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all'\n",
      "b'mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus'\n",
      "b'himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him'\n",
      "b'as he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the'\n",
      "b'spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him'\n",

      "b'the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him'\n",
      "b'and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue'\n",
      "b'all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the'\n",

      "b'And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble'\n",
      "b'Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was'\n",
      "b'honoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him'\n",
      "b'chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the'\n",

      "b'the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can'\n",
      "b'withstand, came over his eyes.'\n",
      "b'Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of'\n",
      "b'Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the'\n",
      "b'Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has'\n",
      "b'burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful'\n",
      "b'vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but'\n",
      "b'in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that'\n",

      "b'Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the'\n",
      "b'Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part'\n",
      "b'of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the'\n",
      "b'metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with'\n",
      "b'blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,'\n",

      "b'out much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from'\n",
      "b'Lycia hither.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew'\n",

      "b'\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and draw'\n",
      "b'the arrow out of my shoulder.\"'\n",
      "b'Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,'\n",
      "b'whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been made'\n",
      "b'in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter of'\n",
      "b'aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and'\n",
      "b'stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me'\n",
      "b\"to come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. He has been\"\n",
      "b'too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I'\n",
      "b'shall not see the light of the sun much longer.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple'\n",
      "b'and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and'\n",
      "b'said, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set'\n",
      "b'in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I'\n",
      "b'have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men'\n",
      "b'apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not'\n",
      "b\"fight him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come, strike her with your\"\n",
      "b'spear and wound her.\"'\n",
      "b'When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again'\n",
      "b'took his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce'\n",
      "b'even than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain'\n",
      "b'shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall'\n",
      "b'of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute'\n",
      "b'to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of'\n",
      "b'the buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are'\n",
      "b'smothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps'\n",
      "b'out over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about'\n",
      "b'among the Trojans.'\n",
      "b'He killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one with a'\n",
      "b'thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with'\n",
      "b'a sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck'\n",
      "b'and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and'\n",
      "b'Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came'\n",
      "b'back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an'\n",
      "b'end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of'\n",
      "b'Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with'\n",
      "b'age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took'\n",
      "b'both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he'\n",
      "b'nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided'\n",
      "b'his wealth among themselves.'\n",
      "b'Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they'\n",
      "b'were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the'\n",
      "b'neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For'\n",
      "b'all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and'\n",
      "b'stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his'\n",
      "b'comrades to take them back to the ships.'\n",
      "b'When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through'\n",
      "b'the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.'\n",
      "b'When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where is'\n",
      "b'now your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in'\n",
      "b'respect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia'\n",
      "b'that can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at'\n",
      "b'this fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly'\n",
      "b'work among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man--unless indeed'\n",
      "b'he is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices,'\n",
      "b'and and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"'\n",
      "b'And the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other than'\n",
      "b'the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,'\n",
      "b'and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is'\n",
      "b\"the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's\"\n",
      "b'help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of'\n",
      "b'darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have'\n",
      "b'taken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow'\n",
      "b'went through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should'\n",
      "b'send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I have not'\n",
      "b'killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have'\n",
      "b\"neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stables there are eleven\"\n",
      "b'excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths'\n",
      "b'spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,'\n",
      "b'champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and again'\n",
      "b'when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and'\n",
      "b'horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not'\n",
      "b'listen to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but I'\n",
      "b'was thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,'\n",
      "b'and I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be'\n",
      "b'ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only'\n",
      "b'with my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have'\n",
      "b'already hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and'\n",
      "b'though I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more'\n",
      "b'furious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my'\n",
      "b\"band of Trojans to Ilius in Hector's service, and if ever I get home\"\n",
      "b'again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my'\n",

      "b'the bow and set it on a hot fire--such pranks as it plays me.\"'\n",

      "b'against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of'\n",
      "b'arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can'\n",
      "b'speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove'\n",
      "b'again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely'\n",
      "b'back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand'\n",
      "b\"upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man's onset while I\"\n",
      "b'look after the horses.\"'\n",
      "b'\"Aeneas,\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if we'\n",
      "b'have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for'\n",

      "b'it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The'\n",
      "b'son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore'\n",
      "b'drive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.\"'\n",
      "b'They then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of'\n",
      "b'Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomed,'\n",
      "b'\"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes'\n",
      "b'speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful'\n",

      "b'Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us'\n",
      "b'retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get'\n",
      "b'killed.\"'\n",
      "b'Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for I'\n",
      "b'shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight nor'\n",
      "b'fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but'\n",
      "b'will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of'\n",
      "b'no man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take'\n",
      "b'both back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart--if'\n",
      "b'Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your'\n",
      "b'horses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be'\n",
      "b\"sure you spring Aeneas' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the\"\n",
      "b'Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in'\n",
      "b'payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move'\n",
      "b'under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his mares to'\n",
      "b\"them without Laomedon's knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four\"\n",
      "b'are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall'\n",
      "b'win great glory if we can take them.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to'\n",
      "b'them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\" said'\n",
      "b'he, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try'\n",
      "b'with my spear.\"'\n",
      "b'He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the'\n",
      "b'shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on'\n",
      "b'till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out'\n",
      "b'and said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out'\n",
      "b'for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\"'\n",
      "b'But Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit, and'\n",
      "b'before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall'\n",
      "b'glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\"'\n",
      "b\"With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus's\"\n",
      "b'nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the'\n",
      "b'bronze point cut through the root of his tongue, coming out under his'\n",
      "b'chin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell'\n",
      "b'heavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was'\n",
      "b'reft of life and strength.'\n",
      "b'Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing'\n",
      "b'lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion'\n",
      "b'in the pride of strength, with shield and spear before him and a cry of'\n",
      "b'battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face'\n",
      "b'him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great'\n",
      "b'that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore'\n",
      "b'it aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin'\n",
      "b'where the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" The'\n",
      "b'stone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged'\n",
      "b'edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped'\n",
      "b'himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night'\n",
      "b'fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished'\n",
      "b\"then and there, had not his mother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had\"\n",
      "b'conceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to'\n",
      "b'mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. She'\n",
      "b'protected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest'\n",
      "b'some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.'\n",
      "b'Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of'\n",
      "b'Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. He'\n",
      "b'made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the'\n",
      "b\"reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas's horses\"\n",
      "b'and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so'\n",
      "b'done he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued'\n",
      "b'above all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to'\n",
      "b'take them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized'\n",
      "b'the reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.'\n",
      "b'Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in'\n",
      "b'hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that'\n",
      "b'can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of'\n",
      "b'cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew'\n",
      "b'at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The'\n",
      "b'point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for'\n",
      "b'her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand,'\n",
      "b'so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the'\n",
      "b'blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat'\n",
      "b'bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are'\n",
      "b'immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus'\n",
      "b'Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest'\n",
      "b'some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and'\n",
      "b'Diomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war and'\n",
      "b'battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If'\n",
      "b'you meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the'\n",

      "b'The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the'\n",
      "b'wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all'\n",
      "b'besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,'\n",
      "b'with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she'\n",
      "b'fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have'\n",
      "b'his horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me your'\n",

      "b'by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father'\n",
      "b'Jove.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She'\n",
      "b'mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her'\n",
      "b'and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew'\n",

      "b'herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her'\n",
      "b'and caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings has been'\n",

      "b'in the face of day?\"'\n",
      "b'And laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,'\n",

      "b'of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave and'\n",
      "b'of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of'\n",

      "b\"upon his eyes. Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\"\n",
      "b'with such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but'\n",

      "b'With these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your life'\n",
      "b'would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he was'\n",
      "b'far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon you'\n",
      "b'and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said,'\n",
      "b'\"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of'\n",
      "b'passion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself'\n",
      "b'as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.'\n",
      "b'Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from'\n",
      "b'meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will'\n",
      "b'send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond of battle'\n",
      "b'though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes'\n",
      "b'out alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"'\n",
      "b'With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,'\n",
      "b'whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.'\n",
      "b'Then Nestor rose and spoke, \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"the Achaean land is'\n",
      "b'fallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator'\n",
      "b'among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me'\n",
      "b'concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not'\n",
      "b'grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many a'\n",
      "b'time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave his'\n",
      "b'body and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,'\n",
      "b'Minerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the'\n",
      "b'Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon'\n",
      "b'under the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river'\n",
      "b'Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,'\n",
      "b'with the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders--Areithous whom'\n",
      "b\"men and women had surnamed 'the Mace-man,' because he fought neither\"\n",
      "b'with bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron'\n",
      "b'mace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in'\n",
      "b'a narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was'\n",
      "b'too quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to'\n",
      "b'earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which Mars'\n",
      "b'had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grew'\n",
      "b'old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion,'\n",
      "b'who in this same armour challenged the foremost men among us. The'\n",
      "b'others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight him though'\n",
      "b'none other would venture; I was the youngest man of them all; but when'\n",
      "b'I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and'\n",
      "b'strongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay'\n",
      "b'sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I'\n",
      "b'then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who would face'\n",
      "b'him. But you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of'\n",
      "b'you any stomach for fighting Hector.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to'\n",
      "b'their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave'\n",
      "b'Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in'\n",
      "b'valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother'\n",
      "b'in arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of'\n",
      "b'Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again'\n",
      "b'spoke, saying: \"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he'\n",
      "b'come alive out of this fight he will have done good service alike to'\n",
      "b'his own soul and to the Achaeans.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown'\n",
      "b'it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their'\n",
      "b'hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the'\n",
      "b'vault of heaven, \"Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or on'\n",
      "b'the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself.\"'\n",
      "b'As they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and'\n",
      "b'from it there fell the very lot which they wanted--the lot of Ajax. The'\n",
      "b'herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.'\n",
      "b'When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon it'\n",
      "b'and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the'\n",
      "b'herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw his mark he knew it and was'\n",
      "b'glad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the lot is mine,'\n",
      "b'and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour;'\n",
      "b'meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves that the'\n",
      "b'Trojans may not hear you--or aloud if you will, for we fear no man.'\n",
      "b'None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was born'\n",
      "b'and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"'\n",
      "b'With this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus'\n",
      "b'would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father'\n",
      "b'Jove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory to'\n",
      "b'Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector also'\n",
      "b'and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming'\n",
      "b'bronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars'\n",
      "b'when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one'\n",
      "b'another--even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward'\n",
      "b'with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and'\n",
      "b'strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the'\n",
      "b'Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat'\n",
      "b'quickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks'\n",
      "b'behind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his'\n",
      "b'shield in front of him like a wall--a shield of bronze with seven folds'\n",
      "b'of oxhide--the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the'\n",
      "b'best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed'\n",
      "b'bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding'\n",
      "b'this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector,'\n",
      "b'and menaced him saying, \"Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what'\n",
      "b'kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted'\n",
      "b'Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in'\n",
      "b'anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us'\n",
      "b'who are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"'\n",
      "b'And Hector answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,'\n",
      "b'treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.'\n",
      "b'I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am quick'\n",
      "b'to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this I deem the'\n",
      "b'main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and horsemen, and'\n",
      "b'in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would'\n",
      "b'not take such a man as you are off his guard--but I will smite you'\n",
      "b'openly if I can.\"'\n",
      "b'He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck the'\n",
      "b'sevenfold shield in its outermost layer--the eighth, which was of'\n",
      "b'bronze--and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide it'\n",
      "b'stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of the'\n",
      "b'son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, and'\n",
      "b'pressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced'\n",
      "b'the shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life.'\n",
      "b'They then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on'\n",
      "b'one another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and'\n",
      "b\"endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax's shield, but the\"\n",
      "b'bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax then'\n",
      "b'sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear went through'\n",
      "b'it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashed'\n",
      "b'his neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hector'\n",
      "b'did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his brawny hand seized'\n",
      "b'a stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this he'\n",
      "b'struck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was in its middle, so that'\n",
      "b'the bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone,'\n",
      "b'swung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of'\n",
      "b\"a rock broke Hector's shield inwards and threw him down on his back\"\n",
      "b'with the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once.'\n",
      "b'Thereon they would have hacked at one another in close combat with'\n",
      "b'their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come'\n",
      "b'forward, one from the Trojans and the other from the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans--Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men; these'\n",
      "b'parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said, \"My'\n",
      "b'sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are dear'\n",
      "b'to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests of'\n",
      "b'night may not be well gainsaid.\"'\n",
      "b'Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was he'\n",
      "b'that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept his'\n",
      "b'saying.\"'\n",
      "b'Then Hector said, \"Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and'\n",
      "b'strength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others'\n",
      "b'of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will'\n",
      "b'fight anew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to'\n",
      "b'the other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be'\n",
      "b'well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships,'\n",
      "b'and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while I,'\n",
      "b'in the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their'\n",
      "b'women, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us,'\n",
      "b'moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and'\n",
      "b\"Trojans, 'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled and\"\n",
      "b'parted in friendship.\\'\"'\n",
      "b'On this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and'\n",
      "b'leathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with'\n",
      "b'purple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,'\n",
      "b'and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their'\n",
      "b'hero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty'\n",
      "b'Ajax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved'\n",
      "b'beyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated'\n",
      "b'with victory to Agamemnon.'\n",
      "b'When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon'\n",
      "b'sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of'\n",
      "b'Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into'\n",
      "b'joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them'\n",
      "b'on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off.'\n",
      "b'When they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it,'\n",
      "b'and every man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,'\n",
      "b'and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,'\n",
      "b'as a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to eat and'\n",
      "b'drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with'\n",
      "b'all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--'\n",
      "b'\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans'\n",
      "b'are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,'\n",
      "b'and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well'\n",
      "b'when morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel'\n",
      "b'our dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the'\n",
      "b'ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades'\n",
      "b'home to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow'\n",
      "b'that shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let us'\n",
      "b'set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and'\n",
      "b'let it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them for'\n",
      "b'our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to'\n",
      "b'keep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear'\n",
      "b'hard upon us.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the'\n",
      "b'Trojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by'\n",
      "b'the gates of King Priam\\'s palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \"Hear me,\" he'\n",
      "b'said, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am'\n",
      "b'minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of'\n",
      "b'Atreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants,'\n",
      "b'and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\"'\n",
      "b'He then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.'\n",
      "b'\"Antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find a'\n",
      "b'better saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in'\n",
      "b'good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. I will'\n",
      "b'speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will not give up'\n",
      "b'the woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her from Argos I'\n",
      "b'will restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"'\n",
      "b'On this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race of'\n",
      "b'Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity and'\n",
      "b'goodwill addressed them thus: \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and'\n",
      "b'allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now as'\n",
      "b'hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful. At'\n",
      "b'daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus'\n",
      "b'sons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has'\n",
      "b'come about; and let him also be instant with them that they now cease'\n",
      "b'fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till'\n",
      "b'heaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper'\n",
      "b'in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his way to the ships. He'\n",
      "b'found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of'\n",
      "b'Agamemnon\\'s ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"Son of'\n",
      "b'Atreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the other'\n",
      "b'noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through'\n",
      "b'whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find it'\n",
      "b'acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to'\n",
      "b'Troy--would that he had sooner perished--he will restore, and will add'\n",
      "b'yet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of'\n",
      "b'Menelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me'\n",
      "b'inquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our dead;'\n",
      "b'hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give'\n",
      "b'victory to one or to the other.\"'\n",
      "b'They all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry'\n",
      "b'spoke, saying, \"Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet'\n",
      "b'Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at'\n",
      "b'hand.\"'\n",
      "b'The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed had'\n",
      "b'spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, \"Idaeus, you have'\n",
      "b'heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as'\n",
      "b'concerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are'\n",
      "b'once dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove'\n",
      "b'the mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\"'\n",
      "b'As he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and'\n",
      "b'Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and'\n",
      "b'Dardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came,'\n",
      "b'he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they'\n",
      "b'heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather the'\n",
      "b'corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also'\n",
      "b'hastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to'\n",
      "b'bring in wood.'\n",
      "b'The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the'\n",
      "b'vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when the'\n",
      "b'two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they washed'\n",
      "b'the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted them'\n",
      "b'upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud, so'\n",
      "b'they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having'\n",
      "b'burned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner'\n",
      "b'heaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned'\n",
      "b'them went back to their ships.'\n",
      "b'Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was'\n",
      "b'raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to'\n",
      "b'shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that'\n",
      "b'there might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside'\n",
      "b'it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with'\n",
      "b'stakes.'\n",
      "b'Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove'\n",
      "b'the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune, lord'\n",
      "b'of the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Jove, what mortal in the'\n",
      "b'whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not how'\n",
      "b'the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench'\n",
      "b'all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this'\n",
      "b'wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer think'\n",
      "b'anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much'\n",
      "b'labour for Laomedon.\"'\n",
      "b'Jove was displeased and answered, \"What, O shaker of the earth, are you'\n",
      "b'talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed at'\n",
      "b'what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.'\n",
      "b'Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can'\n",
      "b'shatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you can cover the beach'\n",
      "b'with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be'\n",
      "b'utterly effaced.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was'\n",
      "b'completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their'\n",
      "b'supper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the'\n",
      "b'son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted them'\n",
      "b'with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to the sons'\n",
      "b'of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans bought'\n",
      "b'their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some'\n",
      "b'with whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread a goodly'\n",
      "b'banquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans'\n",
      "b'and their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded them ill and'\n",
      "b'roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon them, and'\n",
      "b'they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground, nor did any'\n",
      "b'dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of Saturn.'\n",
      "b'Then they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.'\n",
      "b'Jove forbids the gods to interfere further--There is an even'\n",
      "b'fight till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory'\n",
      "b'in favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans'\n",
      "b'within their wall--Juno and Minerva set out to help the'\n",
      "b'Trojans: Jove sends Iris to turn them back, but later on'\n",
      "b\"he promises Juno that she shall have her way in the end--Hector's\"\n",

      "b'refused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him'\n",

      "b'detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; she'\n",
      "b'reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the'\n",
      "b'flames, while the women and children are carried into captivity; when'\n",
      "b'he heard all this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour to'\n",

      "b'Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that'\n",
      "b'they had offered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothing'\n",
      "b'by it. Be not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you into'\n",
      "b'any such course. When the ships are burning it will be a harder matter'\n",
      "b'to save them. Take the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour'\n",

      "b'the battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.\"'\n",
      "b'And Achilles answered, \"Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no need'\n",

      "b'fine linen. The old man then laid himself down and waited till morning'\n",

      "b'Patroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him fair Iphis'\n",

      "b'When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans'\n",

      "b'Agamemnon was the first to do so. \"Tell me, Ulysses,\" said he, \"will he'\n",

      "b'if he so would; but he will not take him by force.\"'\n",
      "b'They all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected,'\n",

      "b'NOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night'\n",

      "b'flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the'\n",

      "b'Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of his soul.'\n",
      "b'In the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son of Neleus, and'\n",
      "b'see if between them they could find any way of the Achaeans from'\n",
      "b'destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound his sandals'\n",
      "b'about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion over his'\n",

      "b'were a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his'\n",

      "b'and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given'\n",
      "b'your orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so many'\n",

      "b'And Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly, for'\n",
      "b'he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself--not indeed from'\n",
      "b'sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me'\n",
      "b'to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I was,'\n",

      "b'wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called'\n",
      "b'loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was soon'\n",
      "b'roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and'\n",

      "b'And Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \"My son, all that you have'\n",

      "b'those who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at their'\n",

      "b'by the ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted'\n",

      "b'On this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants of'\n",
      "b'Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaus'\n",

      "b'Meonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask'\n",
      "b'about all this? If you want to find your way into the host of the'\n",

      "b'while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head,'\n",

      "b'With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,'\n",
      "b'and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs of'\n",
      "b'tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the'\n",

      "b\"soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day's toil; their\"\n",
      "b'goodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly in three'\n",
      "b'rows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was'\n",

      "b'while I see to the horses.\"'\n",
      "b'Thereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote them'\n",
      "b'right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being hacked'\n",
      "b'about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs'\n",
      "b'furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds them without'\n",

      "b'without being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they'\n",
      "b'were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he'\n",

      "b'he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then he whistled as'\n",
      "b'a sign to Diomed.'\n",
      "b'But Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he'\n",
      "b'might accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which'\n",
      "b\"the king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\"\n",
      "b'the armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill'\n",
      "b'some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up to'\n",
      "b'him and said, \"Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven'\n",
      "b'thither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\"'\n",
      "b'Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the'\n",

      "b'longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their'\n",
      "b'death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by'\n",
      "b'name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept'\n",
      "b'hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who'\n",

      "b'bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes'\n",
      "b'of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the old'\n",

      "b'to lift it from the table when it was full, but Nestor could do so'\n",
      "b'quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a'\n",

      "b'was against his part of the wall that they came--bringing destruction'\n",
      "b'with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support his'\n",

      "b'Teucer wounded Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on'\n",
      "b'to attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it,'\n",

      "b'he did not leave off fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son'\n",

      "b'down headlong after it with his bronzed armour rattling round him. Then'\n",
      "b'Sarpedon seized the battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it'\n",
      "b'till it all gave way together, and a breach was made through which many'\n",

      "b'Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with an'\n",

      "b'cried aloud to the Trojans, \"Up, Trojans, break the wall of the'\n",

      "b'Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at the'\n",
      "b'wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp'\n",
      "b'spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just'\n",
      "b'outside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;'\n",
      "b'two of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it'\n",
      "b'from the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite'\n",
      "b'easily by himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it light for'\n",
      "b\"him. As a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand and finds it\"\n",
      "b'no burden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right'\n",
      "b'at the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These'\n",
      "b'doors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars to'\n",
      "b'which there was but one key. When he had got close up to them, Hector'\n",
      "b'strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck them'\n",
      "b'in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. He broke both'\n",
      "b'hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight. The'\n",
      "b'portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and the'\n",
      "b'doors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through the'\n",
      "b'force of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face as dark'\n",
      "b'as that of flying night. The gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his'\n",
      "b'body and he had two spears in his hand. None but a god could have'\n",
      "b'withstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared'\n",
      "b'like fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called on them'\n",
      "b'to scale the wall, and they did as he bade them--some of them at once'\n",
      "b'climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates. The'\n",
      "b'Danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all was'\n",
      "b'uproar and confusion.'\n",
      "b'Neptune helps the Achaeans--The feats of Idomeneus--Hector at'\n",

      "b'Samothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the'\n",

      "b'place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the'\n",
      "b'Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.'\n",
      "b'Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he'\n",
      "b'strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath the'\n",
      "b'tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the fourth'\n",
      "b'he reached his goal--Aegae, where is his glittering golden palace,'\n",
      "b'imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there, he yoked his'\n",
      "b'fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all flying in the'\n",
      "b'wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and'\n",
      "b'took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his way over the waves the'\n",
      "b'sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came'\n",
      "b'gambolling round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in'\n",
      "b'her gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the'\n",
      "b'horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet beneath it;'\n",
      "b'and thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of the Achaeans.'\n",
      "b'Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway'\n",
      "b'between Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake'\n",
      "b'stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial'\n",

      "b'either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place'\n",
      "b'until their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host'\n",

      "b'Now the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a'\n",
      "b'storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising'\n",

      "b'earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives,'\n",
      "b'for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice of'\n",
      "b'Calchas.'\n",
      "b'First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,'\n",
      "b'and said, \"Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you'\n",
      "b'will put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am'\n",
      "b'not afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, will'\n",
      "b'be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them'\n",
      "b'in check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where'\n",
      "b'furious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is'\n",
      "b'leading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into'\n",
      "b'your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do the'\n",
      "b'like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though he be'\n",
      "b'inspired by Jove himself.\"'\n",
      "b'As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both of'\n",
      "b'them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made'\n",
      "b'their legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then,'\n",
      "b'as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,'\n",
      "b'and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even so'\n",
      "b'did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and'\n",
      "b'leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know'\n",
      "b'who it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of'\n",
      "b'Telamon, \"Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus, who in'\n",
      "b'the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our ships. It'\n",

      "b'The others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without'\n",

      "b'one side, his helmet and shield came down along with him, and death,'\n",
      "b\"life's foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance, flew\"\n",
      "b'forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid'\n",
      "b'open the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut'\n",
      "b'this vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the'\n",
      "b'dust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his'\n",
      "b'comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from his'\n",
      "b'shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The Trojans came'\n",
      "b'about him on every side and struck his broad and gleaming shield, but'\n",
      "b'could not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard over the son of'\n",
      "b'Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He was never clear of'\n",
      "b'the foe, but was always in the thick of the fight; his spear was never'\n",
      "b'idle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was he to hit'\n",
      "b'someone from a distance or to fight him hand to hand.'\n",
      "b'As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas, son of'\n",

      "b\"stuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus's shield, while the other\"\n",
      "b'lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,'\n",
      "b'but Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between the'\n",
      "b'private parts and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to'\n",
      "b'wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed'\n",
      "b'convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have'\n",
      "b'bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did he'\n",
      "b'move convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones'\n",

      "b'Helenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting him'\n",

      "b'of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.'\n",
      "b'On this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,'\n",
      "b'brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked'\n",
      "b'one another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and the'\n",
      "b'other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate of'\n",
      "b\"Menelaus's corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black beans\"\n",

      "b'winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel--even'\n",
      "b'so did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who'\n",
      "b'in his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the'\n",

      "b'to his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging'\n",
      "b'by his side--for the spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and'\n",
      "b'bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had'\n",
      "b'with him.'\n",
      "b'Pisander then made straight at Menelaus--his evil destiny luring him on'\n",

      "b'broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory;'\n",
      "b'forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon'\n",
      "b'him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with its long and'\n",
      "b'polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield,'\n",
      "b\"and the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak of Menelaus's\"\n",

      "b'as he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of his'\n",
      "b'nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his'\n",
      "b'feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and Menelaus set his'\n",
      "b'heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and vaunted over him saying,'\n",
      "b'\"Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and'\n",
      "b'insatiate of battle though you be, nor shall you lack any of the'\n",
      "b'disgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly'\n",
      "b'she-wolves that you are, you feared not the anger of dread Jove,'\n",
      "b'avenger of violated hospitality, who will one day destroy your city;'\n",
      "b'you stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when'\n",
      "b'you were her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and'\n",
      "b'kill our heroes. A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be'\n",
      "b'stayed. O father Jove, you, who they say art above all, both gods and'\n",
      "b'men, in wisdom, and from whom all things that befall us do proceed, how'\n",
      "b'can you thus favour the Trojans--men so proud and overweening, that'\n",
      "b'they are never tired of fighting? All things pall after a while--sleep,'\n",

      "b'man would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of'\n",
      "b'battle that the Trojans are insatiate.\"'\n",
      "b'So saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body of'\n",
      "b'Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself'\n",
      "b'among those who were in the front of the fight.'\n",
      "b'Harpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come to'\n",
      "b'fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again. He'\n",
      "b\"struck the middle of Menelaus's shield with his spear but could not\"\n",

      "b'through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and'\n",
      "b'breathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm'\n",
      "b'upon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed from'\n",
      "b'his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care; they'\n",
      "b'raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city of'\n",
      "b'Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there was no'\n",
      "b'ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.'\n",
      "b'Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host'\n",
      "b'when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, in'\n",
      "b'order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son of'\n",
      "b'Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in'\n",
      "b'Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it would'\n",
      "b'be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had often told'\n",
      "b'him that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or'\n",
      "b'go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose,'\n",
      "b'therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans would have'\n",
      "b'laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and suffering of'\n",

      "b'went out of him and he was enshrouded in the darkness of death.'\n",
      "b'Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had not'\n",

      "b'serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax'\n",

      "b'they had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool'\n",
      "b'from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the'\n",

      "b'enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from behind on his'\n",
      "b'back and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand, so that his'\n",

      "b'The god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of'\n",

      "b'Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting on my'\n",

      "b'made him give up the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded'\n",
      "b'him, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed'\n",
      "b\"the Achaeans in at their ships' sterns and would not let them come\"\n",

      "b'Apollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of'\n",

      "b'suppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son,'\n",
      "b'whose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves'\n",
      "b'fitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own'\n",
      "b'when his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies'\n",
      "b'stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\"'\n",
      "b'And Vulcan answered, \"Take heart, and be no more disquieted about this'\n",

      "b'come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes of'\n",
      "b'all who behold it.\"'\n",
      "b'When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them'\n",
      "b'towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows blew'\n",
      "b'upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce'\n",
      "b'to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as Vulcan'\n",
      "b'willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into the'\n",
      "b'fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its'\n",
      "b'block, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the'\n",
      "b'tongs in the other.'\n",
      "b'First he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over'\n",
      "b'and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and the'\n",
      "b'baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses, and'\n",
      "b'with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.'\n",
      "b'He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her'\n",
      "b'full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face of'\n",
      "b'heaven--the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men'\n",
      "b'also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing'\n",
      "b'Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.'\n",
      "b'He wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.'\n",
      "b'In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about'\n",
      "b'the city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their'\n",
      "b'chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the'\n",
      "b'music of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door'\n",
      "b'to see them.'\n",
      "b'Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a'\n",
      "b'quarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who'\n",
      "b'had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid'\n",
      "b'damages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was'\n",
      "b'trying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, each man'\n",
      "b'backing the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and'\n",
      "b'the elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the'\n",
      "b'staves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose and'\n",
      "b'each in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down,'\n",
      "b'to be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.'\n",
      "b'About the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,'\n",
      "b'and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept the'\n",
      "b'half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet'\n",
      "b'consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little'\n",
      "b'children kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who were'\n",
      "b'past fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with Mars and'\n",
      "b'Pallas Minerva at their head--both of them wrought in gold and clad in'\n",
      "b'golden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting gods,'\n",
      "b'while they that followed were smaller. When they reached the place'\n",
      "b'where they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which live'\n",
      "b'stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here, then,'\n",
      "b'they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them there were'\n",
      "b'two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or cattle,'\n",
      "b'which presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing on'\n",
      "b'their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those who'\n",
      "b'were in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and killed'\n",
      "b'the shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much noise'\n",
      "b'among the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, and'\n",
      "b'made with all speed towards them; when they reached them they set'\n",
      "b'battle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed their'\n",
      "b'bronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and Riot, and'\n",
      "b'fell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound,'\n",
      "b'and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging'\n",
      "b\"him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. They\"\n",
      "b'went in and out with one another and fought as though they were living'\n",
      "b\"people haling away one another's dead.\"\n",
      "b'He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.'\n",
      "b'Many men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen to'\n",
      "b'and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching'\n",
      "b'the headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,'\n",
      "b'and they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time'\n",
      "b'when they should again reach the headland. The part that they had'\n",
      "b'ploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of'\n",
      "b'gold, still looked as if it were being ploughed--very curious to behold.'\n",
      "b'He wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping'\n",
      "b'with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the'\n",
      "b'ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them in'\n",
      "b'bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them there'\n",
      "b'were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing'\n",
      "b'them to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in'\n",
      "b'silence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under an'\n",
      "b'oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up,'\n",
      "b'while the women were making a porridge of much white barley for the'\n",
      "b\"labourers' dinner.\"\n",
      "b'He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines were'\n",
      "b'loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the vines were'\n",
      "b'trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal all round it,'\n",
      "b'and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, and'\n",
      "b'by this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage. Youths'\n",
      "b'and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in'\n",
      "b'plaited baskets; and with them there went a boy who made sweet music'\n",
      "b'with his lyre, and sang the Linos-song with his clear boyish voice.'\n",
      "b'He wrought also a herd of horned cattle. He made the cows of gold and'\n",
      "b'tin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go and'\n",
      "b'feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along'\n",
      "b'with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and'\n",
      "b'their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened'\n",
      "b'on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as he'\n",
      "b'might they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore'\n",
      "b\"through the bull's thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels,\"\n",
      "b'but the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their'\n",
      "b'dogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by barking and'\n",
      "b\"keeping out of harm's way.\"\n",
      "b'The god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and a large'\n",
      "b'flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.'\n",
      "b'Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made in'\n",
      "b'Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens whom'\n",
      "b\"all would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens\"\n",
      "b'wore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were'\n",
      "b'slightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while the young'\n",
      "b'men had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they'\n",
      "b'would dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were a'\n",
      "b'potter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whether'\n",
      "b'it will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another,'\n",
      "b'and much people was gathered joyously about the green. There was a bard'\n",
      "b'also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about'\n",
      "b'performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.'\n",
      "b'All round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream of'\n",
      "b'the river Oceanus.'\n",
      "b'Then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made a'\n",
      "b'breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made a helmet, close'\n",
      "b'fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhanging'\n",
      "b'it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.'\n",
      "b'Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it and'\n",
      "b'set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a falcon'\n",
      "b'from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming armour'\n",
      "b'from the house of Vulcan.'\n",
      "b'Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour'\n",
      "b'which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.'\n",
      "b'NOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of'\n",
      "b'Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the'\n",
      "b'ships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son'\n",
      "b'fallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of'\n",
      "b'his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among'\n",
      "b'them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may'\n",
      "b\"we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven's will that he has\"\n",
      "b'fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,'\n",
      "b'which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"'\n",
      "b'As she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out'\n",
      "b'bravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none'\n",
      "b'dared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to'\n",
      "b'still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he'\n",
      "b'was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made'\n",
      "b'him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he'\n",
      "b'said to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet'\n",
      "b'handiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have'\n",
      "b'fashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon'\n",
      "b'the son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his'\n",
      "b'body, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"'\n",
      "b'Silver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this'\n",
      "b'matter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome'\n",
      "b'flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He'\n",
      "b'may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as'\n",
      "b'ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;'\n",
      "b'unsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might'\n",
      "b'and main.\"'\n",
      "b'As she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then'\n",
      "b'dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his'\n",
      "b'body might suffer no change.'\n",
      "b'Then Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on'\n",
      "b'the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at'\n",
      "b'the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were'\n",
      "b'about the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of'\n",
      "b'assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so'\n",
      "b'long from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,'\n",
      "b'came limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they'\n",
      "b'came, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of'\n",
      "b'all came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of'\n",
      "b'Antenor had struck him with a spear in battle.'\n",
      "b'When the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of'\n",
      "b'Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,'\n",
      "b'when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have'\n",
      "b\"been better, had Diana's arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\"\n",
      "b'took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the'\n",
      "b'less would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It'\n",
      "b'has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long'\n",
      "b'indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.'\n",
      "b'If we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from'\n",
      "b'me: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm'\n",
      "b'forthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they'\n",
      "b'will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be'\n",
      "b'to rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away'\n",
      "b'his anger.'\n",
      "b'Then Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the'\n",
      "b'middle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it'\n",
      "b'is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly'\n",
      "b'to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who'\n",
      "b'can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be'\n",
      "b'disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you'\n",
      "b'other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken'\n",
      "b'to me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:'\n",
      "b'Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we'\n",
      "b'were assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had'\n",
      "b'been awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of'\n",
      "b\"heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove's daughters, shuts men's eyes to\"\n",
      "b'their destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but'\n",
      "b'hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.'\n",
      "b'\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest'\n",
      "b'whether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on'\n",
      "b'the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair'\n",
      "b\"city of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, 'Hear me, all\"\n",
      "b'gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day'\n",
      "b'shall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child'\n",
      "b'into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are'\n",
      "b\"of my blood and lineage.' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\"\n",
      "b\"'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\"\n",
      "b'Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall'\n",
      "b'between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about'\n",
      "b\"him who are of your blood and lineage.'\"\n",
      "b'\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,'\n",
      "b'to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit'\n",
      "b'of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the'\n",
      "b'noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child'\n",
      "b'and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there'\n",
      "b'was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and'\n",
      "b'kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,'\n",
      "b\"and said, 'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\"\n",
      "b'ear. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus'\n",
      "b'the son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that'\n",
      "b\"he should reign over the Argives.'\"\n",
      "b'\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught'\n",
      "b'Folly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again'\n",
      "b'invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he'\n",
      "b'whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from'\n",
      "b'heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever'\n",
      "b'angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours'\n",
      "b'that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector'\n",
      "b'was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept'\n",
      "b'thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me'\n",
      "b'of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by'\n",
      "b'way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with'\n",
      "b'you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your'\n",
      "b'tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at'\n",
      "b'once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may'\n",
      "b'see whether what I give you is enough.\"'\n",
      "b'And Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can'\n",
      "b'give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in'\n",
      "b'your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry'\n",
      "b'talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.'\n",
      "b'Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying'\n",
      "b'low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he'\n",
      "b'is fighting.\"'\n",
      "b'Then Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans'\n",
      "b'thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be'\n",
      "b'no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides'\n",
      "b'with fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,'\n",
      "b'for in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the'\n",
      "b'livelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;'\n",
      "b'however much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he'\n",
      "b'knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow'\n",
      "b'weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with'\n",
      "b'meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he'\n",
      "b'has routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them'\n",
      "b'prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence'\n",
      "b'of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.'\n",
      "b'Moreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never'\n",
      "b'gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner'\n",
      "b'of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;'\n",
      "b'let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of'\n",
      "b'reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,'\n",
      "b'son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no'\n",
      "b'disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in'\n",
      "b'the first instance.\"'\n",
      "b'And King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me'\n",
      "b'well, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would'\n",
      "b'have me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name'\n",

      "b'First he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next'\n",

      "b'Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around'\n",
      "b'it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it'\n",
      "b'fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed'\n",
      "b'to buoy him up as though it had been wings.'\n",
      "b\"He also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\"\n",
      "b'great and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles'\n",

      "b'topmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,'\n",
      "b'fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied'\n",
      "b'themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast'\n",
      "b'about them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back'\n",
      "b'towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the'\n",
      "b'horses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as'\n",

      "b'and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth'\n",
      "b'or slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his'\n",

      "b'fall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,'\n",
      "b'shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of'\n",

      "b'So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.'\n",

      "b'Meanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather'\n",
      "b'the gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the'\n",

      "b'In such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune'\n",
      "b'also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and came'\n",
      "b'up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, he'\n",
      "b'asked what Jove\\'s purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder of the'\n",

      "b'And Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore'\n",

      "b'So long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the'\n",

      "b'Achilles was first to speak. \"Who and whence are you,\" said he, \"who'\n",

      "b'And the son of Pelegon answered, \"Great son of Peleus, why should you'\n",

      "b'dark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the'\n",
      "b'ground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill him,'\n",
      "b'hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck the'\n",

      "b'navel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the ground, and'\n",
      "b'the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. Then Achilles'\n",
      "b'set his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over'\n",
      "b'him and saying, \"Lie there--begotten of a river though you be, it is'\n",

      "b'Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste to'\n",
      "b'prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so that'\n",
      "b'all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,'\n",
      "b'the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of'\n",

      "b'like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of his beaming'\n",
      "b'eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over'\n",

      "b'\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, but'\n",
      "b'now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all speed'\n",

      "b'the son of Amphidamas--not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over'\n",
      "b'the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated me'\n",

      "b'And Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay'\n",
      "b'these charges upon me? I will of my own self do all as you have bidden'\n",
      "b'me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one'\n",

      "b'gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,'\n",
      "b'smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even in'\n",

      "b'making piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and looking'\n",
      "b'wondrously like himself.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning about'\n",
      "b'the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King'\n",
      "b'Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood,'\n",
      "b'and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went'\n",
      "b\"out with woodmen's axes and strong ropes in their hands, and before\"\n",
      "b'them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by straight'\n",
      "b'ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of many-fountained'\n",
      "b'Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall branching oak'\n",
      "b'that came thundering down as they felled it. They split the trees and'\n",
      "b'bound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they best'\n",
      "b'could through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been'\n",
      "b'cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to Idomeneus had bidden'\n",
      "b'them, and they threw them down in a line upon the seashore at the place'\n",
      "b'where Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroclus and for'\n",
      "b'himself.'\n",
      "b'When they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole'\n",
      "b'ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered'\n",
      "b'his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man his'\n",
      "b'horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted each'\n",
      "b'his chariot--they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went'\n",
      "b'before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of'\n",
      "b'thousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and'\n",
      "b'covered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and threw'\n",
      "b'upon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so'\n",
      "b'noble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades.'\n",
      "b'When they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid'\n",
      "b'the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of'\n",
      "b'another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the'\n",
      "b'yellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked'\n",
      "b'all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"Spercheius, in vain'\n",
      "b'did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved'\n",
      "b'native land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;'\n",
      "b'fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where'\n",
      "b'is your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my'\n",
      "b'father vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, that'\n",
      "b'I shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero'\n",
      "b'Patroclus.\"'\n",
      "b'As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and'\n",
      "b'all who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun'\n",
      "b'would have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently'\n",
      "b'said to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people'\n",
      "b'will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from'\n",
      "b'mourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their'\n",
      "b'dinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted'\n",
      "b'here, and let the other princes also stay by me.\"'\n",
      "b'When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,'\n",
      "b'but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre a'\n",
      "b'hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully'\n",
      "b'upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen'\n",
      "b'before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped the'\n",
      "b'body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all round'\n",
      "b'it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents;'\n",
      "b'four proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he'\n",
      "b'did so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay'\n",
      "b'and threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans'\n",
      "b'to the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness'\n",
      "b'and fury. Then he committed all to the resistless and devouring might'\n",
      "b'of the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead comrade by name.'\n",
      "b'\"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now'\n",
      "b'doing all that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans'\n",
      "b'shall the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall'\n",
      "b'devour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, for'\n",
      "b\"Jove's daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed him\"\n",
      "b'with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when'\n",
      "b'Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark'\n",
      "b'cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where'\n",
      "b'Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.'\n",
      "b'Now the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore'\n",
      "b'bethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two'\n",
      "b'winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them'\n",
      "b'many drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come and'\n",
      "b'help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies'\n",
      "b'be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to fetch the'\n",
      "b'winds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus'\n",
      "b'when Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood'\n",
      "b'there, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her'\n",
      "b'and each of them called her to him, but Iris would not sit down. \"I'\n",
      "b'cannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to the streams of Oceanus and'\n",
      "b'the land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the immortals,'\n",
      "b'and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill'\n",
      "b'Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; he would'\n",
      "b'have you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are'\n",
      "b'lamenting.\"'\n",
      "b'With this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent'\n",
      "b'the air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until'\n",
      "b'they came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when'\n",
      "b'they reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared'\n",
      "b'under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard and'\n",
      "b'beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double'\n",
      "b'cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the'\n",
      "b'spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the'\n",
      "b'earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the bones of'\n",
      "b'his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,'\n",
      "b'even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,'\n",
      "b'pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.'\n",
      "b'At length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which'\n",
      "b'saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames fell'\n",
      "b'and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the Thracian'\n",
      "b'sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus'\n",
      "b'now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till he'\n",
      "b'fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of'\n",
      "b'Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of'\n",
      "b'their coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus, and all other'\n",
      "b'princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire'\n",
      "b'and quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus son of'\n",
      "b'Menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found, for they'\n",
      "b'lie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has'\n",
      "b'been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We will lay the'\n",
      "b'bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the time when I'\n",
      "b'shall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour'\n",
      "b'not to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards,'\n",
      "b'let those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I am gone, build'\n",
      "b'it both broad and high.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First they'\n",
      "b'poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire.'\n",
      "b'With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their loved'\n",
      "b'comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they'\n",
      "b'then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent.'\n",
      "b'They marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made a'\n",
      "b'foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.'\n",
      "b'When they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles'\n",
      "b'stayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes from'\n",
      "b'the ships--cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with'\n",
      "b'fair girdles, and swart iron.'\n",
      "b'The first prize he offered was for the chariot races--a woman skilled'\n",
      "b'in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for'\n",
      "b'handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man who'\n",
      "b'came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,'\n",
      "b'and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that'\n",
      "b'had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the'\n",
      "b'maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two talents'\n",
      "b'of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then'\n",
      "b'he stood up and spoke among the Argives saying--'\n",
      "b'\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that lie'\n",
      "b'waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I should'\n",
      "b'carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how far'\n",
      "b'my steeds excel all others--for they are immortal; Neptune gave them to'\n",
      "b'my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I shall hold'\n",
      "b'aloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, who'\n",
      "b'many a time has washed them in clear water and anointed their manes'\n",
      "b'with oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing on'\n",
      "b'the ground in the extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set'\n",
      "b'yourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in'\n",
      "b'his horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred'\n",

      "b'But Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had not'\n",

      "b'Then he called on his horses and said to them, \"Keep your pace, and'\n",
      "b'slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than'\n",
      "b'yours, for they are neither of them young.\"'\n",
      "b'The horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so that'\n",
      "b'they were soon nearly up with the others.'\n",
      "b'Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses'\n",
      "b'went, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.'\n",
      "b'Idomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for'\n",

      "b'hear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly--a'\n",
      "b'chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead. He'\n",
      "b'stood up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and'\n",

      "b'There seems to be another pair in front now, and another driver; those'\n",
      "b'that led off at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I'\n",
      "b'saw them at first making their way round the doubling-post, but now,'\n",
      "b'though I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the'\n",
      "b\"reins fell from the driver's hand so that he lost command of his horses\"\n",
      "b'at the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have'\n",

      "b'Tydeus.\"'\n",
      "b'Ajax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \"Idomeneus, why'\n",
      "b'should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares'\n",
      "b'are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor'\n",
      "b'your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down the law.'\n",

      "b'on the chariot holding the reins.\"'\n",
      "b'The captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \"Ajax you are an'\n",
      "b'excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much'\n",
      "b'else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or'\n",
      "b'cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are'\n",
      "b'first. You will then know to your cost.\"'\n",
      "b'Ajax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would'\n",
      "b'have been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen in'\n",
      "b'his place and said, \"Cease your railing, Ajax and Idomeneus; it is not'\n",
      "b'seemly; you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:'\n",
      "b'sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards'\n",
      "b'the winning-post and will be here directly. You will then both of you'\n",
      "b'know whose horses are first, and whose come after.\"'\n",
      "b'As he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his whip'\n",
      "b'lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flew'\n",
      "b'over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and the'\n",
      "b'chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses.'\n",
      "b'There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horses'\n",
      "b'came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in the middle'\n",
      "b'of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests fell in streams'\n",
      "b'on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and'\n",
      "b\"leaned his whip against his horses' yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no\"\n",
      "b'time, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and the'\n",
      "b'ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he unyoked the'\n",
      "b'horses.'\n",
      "b'Next after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed'\n",
      "b'Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even so'\n",
      "b'Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that'\n",
      "b\"draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse's tail\"\n",
      "b'touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between'\n",
      "b'wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than'\n",
      "b\"this behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc's throw\"\n",
      "b\"behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon's mare Aethe\"\n",
      "b'kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had been'\n",
      "b'longer he would have passed him, and there would not even have been a'\n",
      "b\"dead heat. Idomeneus's brave squire Meriones was about a spear's cast\"\n",
      "b'behind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and he was the worst'\n",
      "b'driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot'\n",
      "b'and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry,'\n",
      "b'and stood up among the Argives saying, \"The best man is coming in last.'\n",
      "b'Let us give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second,'\n",
      "b'but the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, and'\n",
      "b\"were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son Antilochus stood up and\"\n",
      "b'claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\" said he, \"I'\n",
      "b'shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my'\n",
      "b\"prize, because you think Eumelus's chariot and horses were thrown out,\"\n",
      "b'and himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the'\n",
      "b'immortals; he would not have come in last if he had done so. If you are'\n",
      "b'sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, with'\n",
      "b'bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from this store if you'\n",
      "b'would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize'\n",
      "b'even than that which you have now offered; but I will not give up the'\n",
      "b'mare, and he that will fight me for her, let him come on.\"'\n",
      "b'Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus, who'\n",
      "b'was one of his dearest comrades. So he said--'\n",
      "b'\"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will'\n",
      "b'give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round it'\n",
      "b'which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\"'\n",
      "b'He bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, and'\n",
      "b'he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received it'\n",
      "b'gladly.'\n",
      "b'But Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An'\n",
      "b'attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep'\n",
      "b'silence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"what is'\n",
      "b'this from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a'\n",
      "b'poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of'\n",
      "b'them, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes'\n",
      "b'and counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,'\n",
      "b\"lest one of the Achaeans say, 'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\"\n",
      "b\"and corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus's, but he\"\n",
      "b\"has greater weight and influence.' Nay, I will determine the matter\"\n",
      "b'myself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come'\n",
      "b'here, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before your'\n",
      "b'chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by'\n",
      "b'earth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully get'\n",
      "b'in the way of my horses.\"'\n",
      "b'And Antilochus answered, \"Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,'\n",
      "b'than you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of the'\n",
      "b'two; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;'\n",
      "b'their tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due'\n",

      "b'from your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven.\"'\n",
      "b'The son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,'\n",
      "b'whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of'\n",
      "b'ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest--even so, O'\n",
      "b'Menelaus, was your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus'\n",
      "b'and said, \"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to'\n",
      "b'you of my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor'\n",
      "b'ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of'\n",
      "b'your judgement; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; no'\n",
      "b'one else could have brought me round so easily, but your good father,'\n",
      "b'your brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my'\n",
      "b'behalf; I therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare'\n",
      "b'to you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am'\n",
      "b'neither harsh nor vindictive.\"'\n",
      "b\"With this he gave the mare over to Antilochus's comrade Noemon, and\"\n",

      "b'the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn,'\n",
      "b'being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him among the'\n",

      "b'in his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither of'\n",

      "b'overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron'\n",

      "b'younger men; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I'\n",

      "b'Thereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of'\n",
      "b'Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently'\n",
      "b'offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought out a'\n",

      "b'his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were'\n",
      "b'now nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.'\n",
      "b'\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray,'\n",
      "b'and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet'\n",
      "b'feel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon the'\n",

      "b'Ulysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax'\n",
      "b'and came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on one'\n",
      "b'of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the'\n",
      "b'Argives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over'\n",

      "b'he speak and they all of them laughed heartily.'\n",
      "b'Antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the'\n",
      "b'bystanders, \"You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown'\n",
      "b'their respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as'\n",
      "b'for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in'\n",
      "b'spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save'\n",
      "b'only Achilles.\"'\n",
      "b'He said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles'\n",
      "b'answered, \"Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose; I'\n",
      "b'shall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave the'\n",
      "b'half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.'\n",
      "b'Then the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that'\n",
      "b'had been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. He'\n",
      "b'stood up and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put on their'\n",

      "b'presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the flesh'\n",
      "b'of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will I'\n",

      "b'Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed'\n",
      "b'son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side'\n",
      "b'of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with'\n",
      "b'fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld'\n",
      "b'them, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice did'\n",
      "b'they spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close'\n",
      "b\"combat. Ajax pierced Diomed's round shield, but did not draw blood, for\"\n",
      "b'the cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus'\n",

      "b'the point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade'\n",
      "b'them leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles'\n",
      "b'then gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and'\n",
      "b'the leathern belt with which to hang it.'\n",
      "b'Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had'\n",

      "b'shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron, for'\n",
      "b'he will have a stock of it on his own premises.\"'\n",
      "b'Then uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax son'\n",
      "b'of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other and Epeus'\n",
      "b'took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Mars. Ajax'\n",
      "b'son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark that had'\n",
      "b'been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it'\n",
      "b\"as though it had been a stockman's stick which he sends flying about\"\n",
      "b'among his cattle when he is driving them, so far did his throw'\n",
      "b'out-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared applause, and'\n",
      "b'his comrades carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.'\n",
      "b'Achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery--ten double-edged'\n",
      "b\"axes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship's mast, some way off\"\n",
      "b'upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot;'\n",
      "b'this was what they were to aim at. \"Whoever,\" he said, \"can hit the'\n",

      "b'the string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and'\n",
      "b'shall have the single-edged axes.\"'\n",
      "b'Then uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus'\n",
      "b'rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer fell'\n",

      "b'hecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for'\n",
      "b'Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird was'\n",
      "b'tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that it'\n",
      "b'hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and'\n",
      "b'the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his arrow ready while'\n",

      "b'promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to'\n",
      "b'Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the'\n",
      "b'clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling'\n",
      "b'upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in the'\n",
      "b\"ground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perched on the ship's mast\"\n",
      "b'hanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went out'\n",
      "b'of her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took'\n",
      "b'all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones'\n",
      "b'to his ships.'\n",
      "b'Then the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had never'\n",
      "b'been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern of'\n",
      "b'flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up--to wit the son of'\n",
      "b'Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of'\n",
      "b'Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we know how far'\n",
      "b'you excel all others both in power and in throwing the javelin; take'\n",
      "b'the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so please you, let'\n",

      "b'Thus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the'\n",

      "b'round him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had'\n",
      "b'killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and'\n",
      "b'caressed him with her hand saying, \"My son, how long will you keep on'\n",
      "b'thus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and'\n",
      "b\"think neither of food nor of woman's embraces; and yet these too were\"\n",
      "b'well, for you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand'\n",
      "b'of fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I say,'\n",
      "b'for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are angry'\n",
      "b'with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you keep Hector'\n",
      "b'at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him go, and accept'\n",
      "b'a ransom for his body.\"'\n",
      "b'And Achilles answered, \"So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion'\n",
      "b'thus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse'\n",
      "b'with one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong'\n",
      "b'city of Ilius. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, from the mansions of'\n",
      "b'Olympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of'\n",
      "b'the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such'\n",
      "b'gifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go'\n",
      "b'alone, with no other Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may'\n",
      "b'drive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble'\n",
      "b'Achilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of death in his'\n",

      "b'another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he'\n",
      "b'will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"'\n",
      "b'On this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. She'\n",
      "b\"went to Priam's house, and found weeping and lamentation therein. His\"\n",
      "b'sons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and their'\n",
      "b'raiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of them with'\n",
      "b'his mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and neck all'\n",
      "b'covered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling in'\n",
      "b\"the mire. His daughters and his sons' wives went wailing about the\"\n",
      "b'house, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead, slain by'\n",
      "b'the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke softly to'\n",
      "b'him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \"Take heart,\" she said,'\n",
      "b'\"Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I bring no evil'\n",
      "b'tidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as a messenger from'\n",
      "b'Jove, who though he be not near, takes thought for you and pities you.'\n",
      "b'The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble Hector, and take with'\n",
      "b'you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. You are to go'\n",
      "b'alone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive'\n",
      "b'your mules and waggon, and bring back to the city the body of him whom'\n",
      "b'noble Achilles has slain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of'\n",
      "b'death, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he'\n",
      "b\"has brought you within Achilles' tent, Achilles will not kill you nor\"\n",
      "b'let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and'\n",
      "b'he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"'\n",
      "b'Iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons to'\n",
      "b'get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast upon'\n",
      "b'the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room,'\n",
      "b'high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were'\n",
      "b'kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. \"Wife,\" said he, \"a messenger has'\n",

      "b'satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for my own'\n",
      "b'part I am greatly moved to pass through the camps of the Achaeans and'\n",
      "b'go to their ships.\"'\n",
      "b'His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \"Alas, what has become'\n",
      "b'of that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among'\n",
      "b'strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships'\n",
      "b'of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of'\n",
      "b'your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage'\n",
      "b'sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity.'\n",
      "b'Let us then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I'\n",
      "b'gave him birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that'\n",
      "b'dogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that'\n",
      "b'terrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus'\n",
      "b'would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him,'\n",
      "b'and thought neither of flight nor of avoiding battle as he stood in'\n",
      "b'defence of Trojan men and Trojan women.\"'\n",
      "b'Then Priam said, \"I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a bird'\n",

      "b'my heart\\'s comforting.\"'\n",
      "b'So saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly'\n",
      "b'vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,'\n",
      "b'twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out ten'\n",
      "b'talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four'\n",
      "b'cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given him'\n",
      "b'when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, but he'\n",
      "b'grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of his son.'\n",
      "b'Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with'\n",
      "b'words of anger. \"Out,\" he cried, \"shame and disgrace to me that you'\n",
      "b'are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to plague me'\n",
      "b'here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn has sent'\n",
      "b'this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, you shall'\n",
      "b'prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will have easier'\n",

      "b'He drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old'\n",

      "b'noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry,'\n",
      "b'Deiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near'\n",
      "b'him. \"Come to me at once,\" he cried, \"worthless sons who do me shame;'\n",
      "b'would that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector.'\n",
      "b'Miserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy--noble'\n",

      "b'those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot,'\n",
      "b'heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people,'\n",
      "b'why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these'\n",
      "b'things upon it that I may set out on my way?\"'\n",
      "b'Thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They'\n",
      "b'brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of the'\n",
      "b'waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on which'\n",
      "b'it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and rings for'\n",
      "b'the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven cubits'\n",
      "b'long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end of'\n",
      "b'the pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making it fast with'\n",
      "b'three turns of the band on either side the knob, and bending the thong'\n",
      "b'of the yoke beneath it. This done, they brought from the store-chamber'\n",
      "b'the rich ransom that was to purchase the body of Hector, and they set'\n",
      "b'it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong harness-mules'\n",
      "b'which the Mysians had on a time given as a goodly present to Priam; but'\n",
      "b'for Priam himself they yoked horses which the old king had bred, and'\n",
      "b'kept for his own use.'\n",
      "b'Thus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their'\n",
      "b'cars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a'\n",
      "b'golden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a'\n",
      "b'drink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horses'\n",
      "b'and said, \"Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since'\n",
      "b'you are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may'\n",
      "b'come safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to the son of'\n",
      "b'Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all'\n",
      "b'Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird'\n",
      "b'of omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you'\n",
      "b'may see it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships'\n",
      "b'of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,'\n",
      "b'however set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships of'\n",
      "b'the Argives.\"'\n",
      "b'And Priam answered, \"Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to'\n",
      "b'lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.\"'\n",
      "b'With this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over his'\n",
      "b'hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed his'\n",
      "b'hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering'\n",
      "b'and prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his'\n",
      "b'eyes to heaven. \"Father Jove,\" he said, \"that rulest from Ida, most'\n",
      "b'glorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and'\n",
      "b'compassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger'\n",
      "b'upon my right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear'\n",
      "b'to you of all birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as'\n",
      "b'I go forth to the ships of the Danaans.\"'\n",
      "b'So did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.'\n",
      "b'Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that'\n",
      "b'fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings'\n",
      "b'were spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and'\n",
      "b\"well-bolted door of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flying over\"\n",
      "b'the city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad'\n",
      "b'and their hearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to'\n",
      "b'mount his chariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under'\n",
      "b'the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before him went the mules'\n",
      "b'drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind'\n",
      "b'these were the horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove'\n",
      "b'swiftly through the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and'\n",
      "b'lamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as'\n",
      "b'they had come down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons'\n",
      "b'and sons-in-law who had followed him went back to Ilius.'\n",
      "b'But Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape'\n",
      "b'the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitied'\n",
      "b'him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, \"Mercury, for it is you'\n",
      "b'who are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear those'\n",
      "b'whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of the'\n",
      "b'Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note of'\n",
      "b'him until he reach the son of Peleus.\"'\n",
      "b'Thus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as'\n",
      "b'he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with'\n",
      "b'which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the wand'\n",
      "b\"with which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he\"\n",
      "b'pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and to'\n",
      "b'the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth in'\n",
      "b'the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his'\n",
      "b'face.'\n",
      "b'Now when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius, they'\n",
      "b'stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river, for'\n",
      "b'the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw Mercury'\n",
      "b'standing near them he said to Priam, \"Take heed, descendant of'\n",
      "b'Dardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man who I'\n",
      "b'think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at'\n",
      "b'least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?\"'\n",
      "b\"When he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was in great\"\n",
      "b'fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end'\n",
      "b'over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and'\n",
      "b'took him by the hand, saying, \"Whither, father, are you thus driving'\n",
      "b'your mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?'\n",
      "b'Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel'\n",
      "b'and relentless? Should some one of them see you bearing so much'\n",
      "b'treasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not your'\n",
      "b'state then be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you is too'\n",
      "b'old to protect you from those who would attack you. For myself, I will'\n",
      "b'do you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for you remind'\n",
      "b'me of my own father.\"'\n",
      "b'And Priam answered, \"It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless'\n",
      "b'some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer'\n",
      "b'as yourself to meet me so opportunely; you are so comely in mien and'\n",
      "b'figure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of'\n",
      "b'blessed parents.\"'\n",
      "b'Then said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, all that you'\n",
      "b'have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking this'\n",
      "b'rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, or'\n",
      "b'are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your son has fallen'\n",
      "b'who was the bravest man among you and was never lacking in battle with'\n",
      "b'the Achaeans?\"'\n",
      "b'And Priam said, \"Who are you, my friend, and who are your parents, that'\n",
      "b'you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?\"'\n",
      "b'The slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \"Sir, you would'\n",
      "b'prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have I'\n",
      "b'set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their'\n",
      "b'ships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled, for'\n",
      "b'Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to fight.'\n",
      "b'I am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon,'\n",
      "b\"and my father's name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old as\"\n",
      "b'you are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast'\n",
      "b'lots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come'\n",
      "b'from the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set'\n",
      "b'battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so'\n",
      "b'eager that their princes cannot hold them back.\"'\n",
      "b'Then answered Priam, \"If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son of'\n",
      "b'Peleus, tell me now the whole truth. Is my son still at the ships, or'\n",
      "b'has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\"'\n",
      "b'\"Sir,\" replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"neither hounds'\n",
      "b'nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the tents'\n",
      "b'by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he has'\n",
      "b'lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten him'\n",
      "b'although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him cruelly'\n",
      "b'round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. You'\n",
      "b'should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with the blood'\n",
      "b'all washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed though many'\n",
      "b'pierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken of'\n",
      "b'your brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.\"'\n",
      "b'The old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \"My son, see what a'\n",
      "b'good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for as'\n",
      "b'sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold'\n",
      "b'Olympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore'\n",
      "b\"at my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven's help guide\"\n",
      "b'me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.\"'\n",
      "b'Then answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, you are'\n",
      "b'tempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me, for'\n",
      "b'you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles whom I'\n",
      "b'fear and hold it great guilt to defraud, lest some evil presently'\n",
      "b'befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to Argos itself,'\n",
      "b'and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no one'\n",
      "b'should attack you through making light of him who was with you.\"'\n",
      "b'The bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing the'\n",
      "b'whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses. When'\n",
      "b'they reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships, those'\n",
      "b'who were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the slayer'\n",
      "b'of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back the bolts'\n",
      "b'to open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure he had upon'\n",
      "b'his waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of'\n",
      "b'Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built'\n",
      "b'for their king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarse'\n",
      "b'tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and all round it'\n",
      "b'they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set close'\n",
      "b'together. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine which it took'\n",
      "b'three men to force into its place, and three to draw back so as to open'\n",
      "b'the gate, but Achilles could draw it by himself. Mercury opened the'\n",
      "b'gate for the old man, and brought in the treasure that he was taking'\n",
      "b'with him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang from the chariot on to'\n",
      "b'the ground and said, \"Sir, it is I, immortal Mercury, that am come with'\n",
      "b'you, for my father sent me to escort you. I will now leave you, and'\n",
      "b'will not enter into the presence of Achilles, for it might anger him'\n",
      "b'that a god should befriend mortal men thus openly. Go you within, and'\n",
      "b'embrace the knees of the son of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his'\n",
      "b'lovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.\"'\n",
      "b'With these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from'\n",
      "b'his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge of'\n",
      "b'the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house where'\n",
      "b'Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him with his'\n",
      "b'men seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon, and'\n",
      "b'Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his person,'\n",
      "b'for he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table was still'\n",
      "b'there. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and going right up'\n",
      "b'to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands'\n",
      "b'that had slain so many of his sons.'\n",
      "b'As when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed'\n",
